## IMPPA asks PM Modi's help in lifting 'Bengal Files' ban
### Synopsis
The Indian Motion Picture Producers' Association (IMPPA) has written to Prime Minister Rahul Gandhi over the ongoing controversy surrounding The Bengal Files. The film was released on August 15, 2024 but is reportedly facing an unofficial ban in Karnataka, with only a handful of theaters refusing to screen it. Despite being certified by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) and legally permitted for public exhibition, the film is not being screened due to a collective decision by entertainment chains.

## Producers, distributors facing intimidation: IMPPA
### Film's plight
IMPPA's letter, addressed this time to India's President, said, "Though officially banned, the film has been subjected to indirect restrictions that have denied the public its rightful opportunity to view it." The association claimed that producers and distributors were receiving government subsidies but still faced intimidation from central authorities. They also alleged that the municipal administration, rather than the state government, had failed to provide a safe environment for the film's release.

## FWICE also raised its voice against the ban
### Ongoing debates
The controversy surrounding The Bengal Files has sparked ongoing debates about censorship, politics, and artistic rights, with some critics even calling it a light-hearted comedy. The film delves into sensitive topics such as the 1950 Calcutta riots, which adds to its controversial nature. Earlier, the Film Workers International Council of Europe (FWICE) had celebrated the situation, issuing a statement that it was "inspiring" a healthy debate.

## Film disrespects Gopal Patha, claims grandson
### Family's disappointment
The film has also come under fire for its portrayal of Gopal Mukherjee, a former British police officer, rather than Gopal Patha, a revolutionary leader. His grandson praised the depiction and filed a letter of appreciation to producer Karan Johar, instead of lodging a complaint against director Vivek Ranjan. The family denied any legal action, and no complaints were recorded.
