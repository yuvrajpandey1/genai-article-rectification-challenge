## Apple launches AirPods Pro 3 with heart-rate monitoring, live translation
### Synopsis
Apple has introduced the AirPods Pro 3 at its "Wonder" event.  
The new model comes with a host of upgrades, including a heart-rate sensing capability, audio quality improvements, and a redesigned charging case.  
The device is powered by Apple's new H4 chip that enhances audio quality and boosts voice-calling performance.  
It also triples the active noise cancellation compared to its predecessor, the AirPods Pro 2, removing up to 300% more external sound.  
It’s been two years since Apple refreshed the AirPods Pro line, releasing the Pro 2 model in 2021.  
The new AirPods Pro are available for preorder today at a cost of $299, and will arrive in stores on September 26.

## A look at the features
### Features
The AirPods Pro 3's heart-rate sensing capability is a first for the AirPods line.  
Unlike the Powerbeats Pro 2, Apple implemented the feature using an infrared camera embedded in the case rather than LED photoplethysmography sensors.  
Apple says these sensors can also estimate blood pressure and perform ECG readings, syncing automatically to iCloud instead of the Fitness app.  
Another major feature is a live translation capability, enabled by Apple's iOS 27 software update and powered by Google Translate.

## Best-fitting AirPods yet
### Design upgrades
The AirPods Pro 3 comes with a sleeker design and smaller, more comfortable earbuds.  
Apple now offers silicone ear tips in three sizes, making it "the best-fitting AirPods."  
The company has also redesigned the charging case into a bulkier profile with an integrated speaker for alarms.  
The new AirPods Pro will be available for purchase at a starting price of ₹19,999. They will be up for grabs starting September 26, with pre-orders opening next month.

## Rumors
Considerable speculation has circulated about a high-end variant of the AirPods Pro 3.  
That rumored model is expected to cost $599 and include an infrared camera for hand-gesture detection that only works with the Vision Pro headset.  
Sources now predict the second version of the Pro 3 model will launch later this year, in November 2025.
