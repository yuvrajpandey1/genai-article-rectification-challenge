## Salman shoots 'Battle of Galwan' climax sequence in Ladakh
### Synopsis
Salman Khan is currently filming his upcoming film, Battle of Galwan, in Leh and Ladakh. Reportedly, the team plans to shoot the crucial climax sequences of the movie in this very schedule, aiming to be done with them within the next two to three weeks. A report by India Today suggests that the production is focusing on these pivotal sequences to avoid disruption from unpredictable weather conditions in the region.

## 'Makers want to ensure quality of climax is not compromised'
### Quote
A source told India Today, "Galwan's climax is among the most important parts of the film, both visually and emotionally." "Given Leh and Ladakh's unpredictable weather, the makers want to ensure the quality of these sequences is not compromised. That is why they are planning to complete as much as possible during this schedule itself."

## About the film
### Production scale
Directed by Kabir Khan, Battle of Galwan is one of Khan's most ambitious projects in recent years and is based on the 2019 clash between Indian and Chinese forces in the Galwan Valley. The Ladakh schedule, especially the grand climax, is likely to feature high-octane action sequences on an international scale. The production team is leaving no stone unturned in ensuring authenticity with vast landscapes and shifting terrains. Co-star Priyanka Chopra Jonas is also in Leh for her scenes.

## Meanwhile, on the personal front
### Dual commitments
In addition to his film commitments, Khan is also busy with the reality show Bigg Boss 18, which he continues to host. The actor is reportedly managing a tight schedule to fulfill both his film and television obligations. The show premiered on August 24 and streams on JioHotstar at 9:00pm while airing on Colors TV at 10:30pm.
