## Pakistan to host Sri Lanka for three ODIs in November
### Synopsis
Pakistan are set to host Sri Lanka for a three-match ODI series, starting November 18 this year. The iconic Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, which has hosted several riveting internationals, is the designated venue for all three ODIs (November 18, 20, and 22). Notably, Pakistan are in for a packed home season, which also includes an all-format tour by South Africa in October. Here are further details.

## SL's first visit to Pakistan since 2019
### Historic encounter
The upcoming ODI series will mark Sri Lanka's first visit to Pakistan for a bilateral affair since 2019. However, SL traveled to the nation for their 2023 Asia Cup encounter against Afghanistan. In 2019, hosts Pakistan won the three-ODI series 2-0, with the opener being abandoned. Back then, the Lankans visited Pakistan after over a decade. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was barred from hosting internationals in 2009 when the Sri Lankan team bus was attacked outside Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore.

## Pakistan vs SL in ODIs
### Information
The last time these two teams faced off in an ODI was during the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup, when Pakistan registered a six-wicket victory over Sri Lanka. As per ESPNcricinfo, Pakistan have a 93-59 lead over SL in ODI cricket.

## Pakistan, SL to feature in Asia Cup
### Upcoming tournaments
Ahead of the impending ODI series, both Pakistan and Sri Lanka will compete in an eight-team T20 Asia Cup in the UAE, starting September 9.
