'Coal Emperor': Anil Sharma signs Sunny Deol for slapstick comedy
Thursday November 06, 2024

## 'Coal Emperor': Anil Sharma plans comedy with Sunny Deol
### Synopsis
Actor Sunny Deol and filmmaker Anil Sharma, who made headlines with their 2022 film Gadar 2, are reportedly reuniting for a spin-off titled Coal Emperor. According to Bollywood Hungama, the duo discussed a light-hearted comedy set in the world of coal smuggling.

## Film set against backdrop of smuggling ring
### Project details
A source told the portal, "Anil Sharma and Sunny Deol have been sketching several concepts over the last five months - and the one which has excited both of them is a modest family drama set around a diamond-smuggling ring." "The script is still in early draft stages and no dialogues have been written yet," added the source.

## Deol currently juggling multiple projects
### Actor's commitments
Deol is juggling multiple projects: he started shooting for a Netflix original with Sidharth Malhotra and Karan Johar as director, followed by a romantic thriller produced by Yash Raj Films. He is also portraying Lord Shiva in Ramayana and is expected to rejoin that shoot in early 2024. In the release slate, Border 2 and Lahore: 1947 are scheduled for 2027 worldwide.

## Will it be 'Gadar 3' or 'Coal Emperor'?
### Director's projects
Sharma is reportedly shelving Gadar 3 and has confirmed that the Gadar franchise will be retired rather than expanded into a trilogy. In an interview with Pinkvilla in 2024 he allegedly said writers had scrapped all Gadar ideas. The director plans to decide which film to shoot next by March 2025, and both Coal Emperor and Gadar 3 are said to have completed scripts.

## Additional notes
Industry insiders say Coal Emperor could enter production as early as mid-2023 if financing, secured by Anil Sharma's production house, is finalized. Box office predictions estimate the film will easily cross Rs 50 crore within its first weekend.

Stay tuned to Pinkvilla and Bollywood Hungama for official confirmations and release dates.
