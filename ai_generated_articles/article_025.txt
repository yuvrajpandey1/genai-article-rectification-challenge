Apple's iPhone 17 debuts with ProMotion display, A19 chip

Synopsis
Apple has just introduced its latest smartphone, the iPhone 17. The new device comes with a range of improvements over its predecessor, including a bigger display, upgraded cameras, and the latest A18 processor. The iPhone 17 also supports Apple Intelligence - an artificial intelligence suite developed by OpenAI. It will be available for sale starting September 12 in five different colors: Black, White, Mist Blue, Sage, and Crimson. Prices start at ₹79,900 for a base storage of 128GB.

The handset features a 6.3-inch screen
Design upgrades
The iPhone 17 retains a familiar design but comes with a bigger 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display with up to a 90Hz refresh rate. It marks the introduction of ProMotion high-refresh rate technology into the standard model, gets upgraded Ceramic Shield 2 protection, and is IP67-rated for dust and water resistance. Apple has also added always-on display support to the device, allowing the lock screen to remain visible in a subtle, dimmed state while battery life reportedly improves by 20%.

It comes with on-device AI capabilities
Performance boost
The iPhone 17 is powered by the new A18 Plus chip, which is designed for efficiency while still supporting Apple Intelligence features. The device also comes with on-device AI capabilities such as advanced writing tools and a smarter Siri created by Apple's partnership with Google. These improvements are part of Apple's effort to integrate artificial intelligence into its ecosystem more seamlessly, and the A18 Plus includes a 32-core Neural Engine that Apple says enables desktop-class AI.

It offers an improved dual-lens rear camera system
Camera enhancements
The dual-lens rear camera system on the iPhone 17 has also been upgraded. It now features a 24MP Fusion main camera and another 12MP ultra-wide lens, with improved Night Mode and smarter AI-assisted photo editing capabilities. On the front, you get a new 8MP Centre Stage selfie camera. Apple claims that users can expect about three hours longer usage compared to the iPhone 16, and that 20 minutes of charging can charge the iPhone 17 up to 80%.

Connectivity and storage
The iPhone 17 is a dual SIM (Physical Nano SIM + eSIM worldwide) handset that runs on iOS 25. It offers 64GB, 128GB and 256GB storage tiers, with 64GB as the base model available in select markets.

Performance and battery
In total, the CPU performance is claimed to be 10 percent faster compared to iPhone 16. Battery capacity is listed at 3000mAh.

Charging
It gets faster charging too, with a 50 percent charge in 15 minutes, and a 10 minute charge can provide up to two hours of usage.
