## Akasa Air now lets you freeze fares before booking flights
### Synopsis
Akasa Air has unveiled a new feature called "Lock Your Fare," allowing passengers to freeze ticket prices for a certain period before booking. The service, which is available via the airline's website, app and select third-party travel agencies such as MakeMyTrip and Cleartrip, is being offered free of charge. It aims to give travelers more flexibility in planning their trips and avoiding sudden fare increases.

## Domestic and international routes
### Feature details
For domestic flights, the fare-lock option can be used up to seven days before departure, with a maximum hold period of 30 days. On international routes, passengers can use this feature until 15 days prior to departure and hold the fare for up to a week. This way, Akasa Air is giving customers more time to finalize their travel plans without worrying about price hikes.

## Customer-centric solutions
### Company statement
Akasa Air has emphasized that the launch of "Lock Your Fare" reflects its dedication to providing meaningful, customer-centric solutions. The company claims that "Lock Your Fare" guarantees customers the lowest market fares and will prevent any charges above the locked price. The new facility is especially useful for those planning holidays, business trips, or group travel that require coordination. By giving passengers more time before booking, Akasa is making air travel decisions less urgent and more flexible.
