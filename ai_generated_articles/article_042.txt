## Rimac unveils new battery tech for next-gen electric supercars
### Synopsis
Rimac Technology, the company famous for its electric supercars, has unveiled a new battery pack platform based on solid-state battery cells. The announcement was made at IAA Mobility in Munich. The Croatian firm is trying to establish itself as a tier 1 automotive industry supplier with this new product lineup.

## From supercar manufacturer to EV supplier
### Business shift
Rimac made a name for itself with electric supercars like the Nevara. However, the company has also been working as an EV supplier for a long time, serving high-profile clients such as Koenigsegg and Aston Martin. In 2021, after an investment from BMW and a merger with Ferrari, Rimac became a more prominent supplier and development partner for OEMs looking for high-performance electric powertrains.

## Solid-state battery platform and e-axles showcased
### Product launch
At the IAA in Munich this week, Rimac unveiled its latest products. These include a solid-state battery platform that integrates Solid Power cells and Toray materials. The new battery pack is touted to be lighter, safer, and more energy-dense than today's packs. Rimac also showcased its "SINTEG 300 & 550" single-motor integrated axles with rotor speeds of up to 50,000 rpm and output envelopes ranging from 1,500–3,600 kW.

## Dual-motor EDU 550 set for series production
### Tech advancements
Rimac's dual-motor EDU 550 will go into series production in 2026 for a global OEM. It has been validated with over 95% peak efficiency and over 11,000Nm of axle torque. The company also showcased domain/zonal ECUs based on NXP S32E2 real-time processors for torque vectoring, HV battery control, body and power distribution, as well as OTA updates.

## Rimac's plans for the future
### Growth strategy
Rimac has two Croatian sites covering around 95,000m2, backed by a €200 million campus. The company says it is preparing capacity for tens of thousands of units per month. Its previous 12-month collaboration list includes BMW Group, CEER Motors, and Porsche. This expansion plan shows Rimac's ambition to become a major player in the EV supply chain with its innovative technology offerings.
