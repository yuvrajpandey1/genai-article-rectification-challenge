## You can now upload audio files on Google's Gemini app
### Synopsis
Google has announced a major update for its Gemini app, allowing users to upload and analyze audio files. The new feature is available on Android, iOS, and the web. You can access it by opening the 'plus' menu for "Files" on mobile or "Upload files" on the web and selecting any audio file format like MP3, M4A, and WAV.

## Audio length restrictions for free and paid users
### User restrictions
Google has set certain restrictions on the audio file uploads. Free users can upload a total audio length of up to 100 minutes, while Google Cloud Pro or Google AI Ultra subscribers can upload up to 30 minutes of audio. The update also supports video uploads (up to five minutes for free users or one hour for paid subscribers) and other supported file types (up to 100MB each).

## You can upload code folders or GitHub repositories
### Upload features
The Gemini app supports uploading one code folder or one GitHub repository with up to 5,000 files, and a maximum size of 1 GB. ZIP files can contain up to 10 files. Overall, you can upload a total of 10 files in any format. This update is part of Google's continuous efforts to improve its AI-powered products and services.

## AI Mode in Google Search gets 5 new languages
### Search expansion
Along with the Gemini app update, Google has also expanded its Search's AI Mode to support five new languages: Hindi, Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, and Korean. This comes with the integration of Gemini 2.5 into Search. The company said in a blog post that this expansion will allow more people to use AI Mode to ask complex questions in their preferred language, while exploring the web more deeply.

## NotebookLM gets new report styles, flashcards, quizzes
### Software update
Google's Gemini-backed NotebookLM software is also getting an update with new report styles in over 8 languages. The reports are based on a user's uploaded documents, files, as well as other media. Standard report formats include study guides, briefing docs, and blog posts. Flashcards and quizzes were also added in the latest NotebookLM update.
