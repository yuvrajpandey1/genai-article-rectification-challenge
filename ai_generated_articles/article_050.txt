Tax reform
The announcement follows the 55th GST Council meeting held on September 4, 2025, chaired by Arun Jaitley, where the government introduced GST 2.0, a landmark reform aimed at making vehicles more affordable and simplifying tax rates in the automotive sector. Under the new framework, GST on small cars, motorcycles up to 350cc, three-wheelers, buses, trucks, and ambulances has been reduced from 28% to 12%. Small cars—defined as vehicles under four metres in length with engines up to 1,000cc (petrol) or 1,200cc (diesel)—will now attract 12% GST with an additional cess of 3%. In contrast, larger vehicles with engines exceeding 1.2 litres (petrol) or 1.5 litres (diesel), as well as motorcycles above 350cc, will now be taxed at 28% GST. For the agricultural sector, GST on tractors, harvesters, threshers, fodder balers, and other farm machinery has been lowered from 12% to 7%. Additionally, all auto components will now carry a uniform GST of 28%, streamlining the overall tax structure in India.
