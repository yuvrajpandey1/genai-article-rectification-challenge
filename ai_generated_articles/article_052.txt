## Prince Harry visits grandma Queen Elizabeth's grave on death anniversary
### Synopsis
Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, paid a private visit to Westminster Abbey in London on the second anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death.

## Prince Harry to attend WellChild Awards
### Charity engagement
Prince Harry's visit to the UK comes ahead of his attendance at the Children in Need Awards. The charity, which he has supported since 2007, celebrates young people living with serious health challenges and honors their caregivers. During the event, Prince Harry will deliver a speech and present an award.

## Hopes for Harry-Charles reunion
### Family dynamics
Prince Harry's visit has sparked speculation of a possible reunion with his father, King Charles III. The two have not met in person since February 2024 due to ongoing estrangement and legal battles over security arrangements in the UK. Despite these tensions, Prince Harry has expressed a desire for reconciliation with his family.

## Strained relationships with other royals
### Family tensions
Apart from King Charles, Prince Harry's relationship with his brother Prince William and sister-in-law Kate Middleton is also strained. However, he has publicly stated his wish for reconciliation. In May, he told BBC News that he "would love reconciliation with my family. There's no point in continuing to fight anymore." This time, he's traveling without his wife, Meghan Markle, or their two kids, Prince Archie, 7, and Princess Lilibet, 4.
