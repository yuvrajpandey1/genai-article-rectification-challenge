### Synopsis
The 2026 Men's ICC T20 World Cup is likely to be held between January 7 and February 8 in India and Sri Lanka. While India will host matches at five venues, two venues are kept for Sri Lanka.

## 15 teams confirmed for the tournament
### Participating nations
So far, 15 teams have confirmed their participation in the 2026 ICC T20 World Cup. These are India, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, South Africa, USA, West Indies, New Zealand, and Pakistan. Ireland and Canada are also confirmed participants, along with the Netherlands and Italy, who qualified for a World Cup for the first time.

## Format of the tournament
### Competition structure
The tournament will follow a format similar to the 2024 T20 World Cup in West Indies and USA. The 20 teams will be divided into four groups of five each, with the top two sides from each group qualifying for the Super Eight.
