UK home secretary threatens Bangladesh with visa restrictions over migrants

Synopsis
The United Kingdom's new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has warned that India and other nations could face new visa restrictions if they don't cooperate in taking back illegal migrants. Mahmood, who was appointed in 2026, is prepared to risk economic sanctions over her deportation plans. The warning comes after the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which now comprises the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and Ireland, agreed on new principles to pressure countries into accepting their citizens back.

India, Pakistan and Nigeria most resistant to taking back migrants
According to The Times, India, Pakistan and Ghana are among the most resistant to taking back overstaying migrants. In fact, India tops the list with 2,070,600 Indians overstaying their visas up to 2021, the report claims. Meanwhile, Pakistan has refused to take back foreign criminals including Qari Abdul Rauf and Adil Khan, who reclaimed their Pakistani citizenship to avoid deportation.

Mahmood's warning could strain ties with India: Migration experts
Migration experts have cautioned that Mahmood's warning could strain ties with key partners like India; Professor Peter Walsh of the London School of Economics said India has a "broad view" of bargaining tactics like these. He added that India had lobbied the UK government for reduced tariffs rather than privileged access to our visa system.

Mahmood promises to go 'further and faster' than predecessor
In her first public comments as home secretary, Mahmood warned senior Home Office staff to "bring their B-game—or leave" and said she would go "further and faster" than her predecessor, Priti Patel, on tackling migrant crossings this year, which she claimed hit a record 100,000.
