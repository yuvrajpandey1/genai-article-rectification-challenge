## How China's STEM visa gives it an edge over US
### Synopsis
China has announced a new visa category, the "young talent" K visa, aimed at attracting global professionals in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The initiative is part of China's strategy to enhance innovation and competitiveness in its high-tech sectors, and the move comes as other countries, notably Canada, have adopted much more liberal immigration policies, which Beijing hopes to emulate.

## A look at the visa
### Visa details
The K visa will go live on October 15 and will require a local sponsoring university or company rather than allowing applicants to arrive without a domestic inviter. It has specific requirements pertaining to age, educational background, and work experience, and does not need a domestic employer/inviting entity. The visa not only targets overseas Chinese communities, but also young people from developed and developing countries, especially the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany.

## Analysts skeptical about effectiveness
### Visa skepticism
China's strengths include its vast market, rapidly advancing universities, an extensive talent network, as well as thousands of industrial tech parks; the "young talent" K visa is expected to leverage these factors, but analysts remain skeptical about its effectiveness. They have called for stringent policy support to ensure the success of this initiative.
