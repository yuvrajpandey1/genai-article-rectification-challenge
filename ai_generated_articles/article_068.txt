## Rohit's absence from international cricket
### Career hiatus
Rohit has been missing from the international cricket scene since India won the ICC Champions Trophy in mid-2025. He had retired from ODI cricket in May, ending a glorious career of 67 matches, 4,301 runs at an average of 40.58 with 12 centuries and a highest score of 212. Now, he is preparing for his return to ODI cricket after a long break.

## Return to ODI fold
### Comeback
Rohit, along with fellow cricketing icon Virat Kohli, is set to make a comeback in the ODI series against Australia. The first match of the series will be played on October 9 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne. Their return has been highly anticipated by Indian cricket fans since their last appearance in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy final in Dubai.

## Will Rohit, Kohli play for India A?
### List A games
Like Rohit, Virat Kohli has also become an ODI specialist after retiring from Tests and T20Is. The dup is likely to play for India A in the List A series against Australia A at home before heading off to Australia for a three-match ODI series, as per Hindustan Times. The legendary cricketers are likely to make their comeback during a three-match List A series against Australia 'A' at the Green Park Stadium in Kanpur, starting September 30.
