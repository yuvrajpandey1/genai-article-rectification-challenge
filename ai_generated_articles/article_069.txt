## Bizarre: PhysicsWallah describes flying slipper as risk in IPO filing
### Synopsis
In a rather unusual turn of events, ed-tech start-up PhysicsWallah has flagged a bizarre incident in its Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP). The document cites an incident from 2021 where a student allegedly threatened a teacher with a slipper during an offline class. The company considers this incident as an operational and reputational risk, especially with its expansion into offline centers.

## Other incidents include staff pushing student
### Student behavior
The slipper incident is a stark reminder of the challenges that come with managing young students in an educational setting. The company has also cited other incidents, including a video of a staff member pushing a student at one of its offline centers. The staffer was later terminated after an internal investigation into the matter.

## IPO to raise ₹38,200cr
### IPO details
Founded as a company in 2018, PhysicsWallah is planning to raise ₹38,200 crore through its initial public offering (IPO). The offer includes a fresh issue of equity shares worth ₹3,100 crore, and an offer for sale (OFS) of stocks aggregating up to ₹720 crore by promoters Alakh Pandey and Prateek Sharma. Both will offload shares worth ₹360 crore each through the OFS.

## Backed by WestBridge Capital, Hornbill and GSV Ventures
### Business strategy
PhysicsWallah offers test preparation courses for competitive exams like JEE, NEET, GATE, and UPSC. The firm operates through online platforms (YouTube, website, apps), some tech-enabled offline centers, and hybrid centers that combine the online teaching with in-person support. Backed by WestBridge Capital, Hornbill and GSV Ventures, PhysicsWallah trimmed its losses to ₹243 crore in the year ending March 2025 from ₹1,131 crore a year ago.
