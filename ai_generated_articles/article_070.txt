## VP election: Voting ends with record 88.3% turnout
### Synopsis
The voting for the Vice Presidential election in India has concluded with a record 88.3% voter turnout. The election was held between the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate CP Radhakrishnan and opposition nominee B Sudershan Reddy. President Droupadi Murmu was among the first to cast her vote at Parliament House, followed by several Union Ministers and MPs from various parties.

## BJD, BRS, SAD abstain from voting
### Political dynamics
The opposition has united for this election, with all 300 of its MPs voting, and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called it an "unprecedented 100% turnout." However, some regional parties like the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chose to abstain from voting. These parties are trying to highlight state-level issues and keep a distance from both the NDA and the Congress-led INDIA bloc.

## Counting of votes begins
### Election progress
The counting of votes started at 6:00pm after the polling ended at 5:00pm. The electoral college for this election comprises members from both Houses of Parliament, with a total strength of 781. BJP MP Bhagwat Karad ruled out any chances of cross-voting in favor of the NDA candidate. Meanwhile, CPI leader P Sandosh Kumar called it a "very close fight" this time around.

## Sudershan Reddy optimistic about people's conscience awakening
### Candidate confidence
NDA's Vice Presidential nominee CP Radhakrishnan expressed confidence in a clear victory for the ruling alliance. He said, "The elections are taking place. It is going to be a big victory for Indian nationalism." On the other hand, opposition nominee B Sudershan Reddy was also optimistic about awakening people's conscience during this election process.

## Deve Gowda arrives to cast vote
### Election strategies
The BJD, BRS, and SAD's decision to abstain from voting is seen as an attempt to highlight state-level issues. Meanwhile, Congress state convenors and party MPs held a strategy meeting with party president Mallikarjun Kharge ahead of the election. Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda also arrived at Parliament House to cast his vote in this high-stakes election.
