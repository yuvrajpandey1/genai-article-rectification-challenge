How 'nepo kids' lifestyles triggered Gen Z protests in Nepal
Synopsis
Before a massive crowd, mostly Gen-Z protestors, took to Kathmandu streets to protest against corruption and the government's social media ban, a social media trend, "Nepo Kid," was trending. The campaign, which spread on platforms like Instagram and Telegram, called the offspring of political leaders "Nepo Kids" and scrutinized their extravagant lifestyles. Users posted pictures and videos showing luxury cars, foreign education, and lavish vacations enjoyed by these kids, highlighting the contrast with ordinary citizens who migrate abroad for work. These migrant workers contribute to just 3.3% of Nepal's GDP via remittances.

Origin of the term 'Nepo kid'
Term origin
The term "Nepo Kid" comes from nepotism, which refers to getting opportunities through family connections instead of merit. It was first coined in South Korea's K-pop scene and later used in Bollywood before being used in the Philippines. In Nepal, it is now being used against the families of former kings and royal relatives.

Accusations of misuse of taxpayer money
Public sentiment
In the social media posts, Reddit users accused political families of misusing taxpayers' money. One post read, "When you see politicians' children, it feels like taxpayers' money has funded their luxury cars, foreign education and lifestyle, while ordinary youths are forced to work hard abroad." Meanwhile, videos with the hashtag #PoliticiansNepoBabyNepal on TikTok suggested these kids were the children of journalists and businessmen, not politicians.

'While we struggle, they live in utter privilege'

"Nepo Kids show off their lifestyle on Instagram and TikTok, but never explain where the money comes from," one Kathmandu Post columnist said in a widely shared piece. "Children of elite politicians know exactly where their parents' money and luxury come from—taxpayers like you and me. While we struggle, they live in utter privilege. Start listing their social media accounts and archiving their content to hold them accountable and prevent them from erasing the evidence," Asheem Man Singh Basnyat, a local television anchor, was quoted as saying in a viral clip.

Protest planned against social media ban
Protest aftermath
These Reddit discussions also suggested the campaign was likely to spill onto the streets, and it did, on Monday. The nepo child campaign quickly gained traction, following fury over the Oli government's recent ban on 260 social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and TikTok, announced on September 14, 2024. Hundreds of thousands of Generation Z protesters, many in school uniforms, marched from Kathmandu's Durbar Square to Parliament on Monday, protesting against corruption and the social media ban.

Economic disparity and censorship
Campaign impact
Clashes with police broke out after protestors smashed over barriers and attempted to storm the parliament building. Police used batons, tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons in response. According to Nepali authorities, at least 76 individuals died from serious injuries sustained during the demonstration, including bullet wounds to the head and chest. The government stated that a curfew would remain in effect in parts of the capital until 10:00pm on Monday night.

TikTok was banned for 3 years in 2023
PM
Prior to Monday's protests, Nepal's prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba defended the government's decision, saying, "The independence of the nation is greater than the loss of jobs of a handful of individuals." Freedom of speech is entirely unrestricted in Nepal, but critics say the Oli government's growing overreach is raising concerns. TikTok was banned for three years in 2023 because of concerns about hate speech and cybercrime but was reinstated after the company agreed to register with the government.

The leaderless movement, dubbed 'The Final Revolution', is demanding transparency and accountability. With endorsements from Bollywood celebrities such as Priyanka Chopra and Salman Khan, many observers predicted the protests would topple the government within 48 hours.
