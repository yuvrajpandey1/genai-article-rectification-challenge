## Why did Hyderabad municipality issue notice to Allu Arjun's family?
### Synopsis
The Greater Secunderabad Municipal Corporation (GSMC) has issued a show-cause notice to Allu Arjun's family over alleged illegal construction at the Allu Business Park in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad. The notice questions why the unauthorized structure shouldn't be demolished and was served on Sunday, September 7, 2024, after an inspection of the property. GSMC's Circle-9 officials carried out the inspection.

## Unauthorized extension discovered during inspection
### Construction details
The Allu Business Park was reportedly sanctioned on a 1,226 square metre plot with permission for two basements and ground plus five floors. However, municipal inspectors discovered an unauthorized extension on the sixth floor, which had not been approved. Officials also noted that the built-up area exceeded the approved 12,260 square feet by nearly 30%.

## Notice warns of potential demolition
### Legal action
The show-cause notice warns that if Arjun's family fails to provide a satisfactory explanation, the entire building may be sealed and demolished, and a penalty of Rs 50 lakh could be imposed. The Allu Business Park, located on Road No. 36 in Jubilee Hills, was built in 2015 by the Allu family. It reportedly houses offices of GA Productions, Allu Studios, and several unrelated start-ups.

## No response from the Allu family yet
### No response
Contrary to initial reports, the Allu family issued an immediate statement denying any wrongdoing and said the disputed fourth-floor extension was part of a pre-approved architectural plan. On the work front, Arjun has reportedly paused film shoots and is preparing for a political foray instead of promoting his upcoming sci-fi film AA22xA6, which was being shot in Hyderabad.
