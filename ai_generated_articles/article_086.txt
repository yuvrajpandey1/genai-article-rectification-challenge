### Image
Verma also spoke about the negative publicity she has been getting since her divorce.

"When you know, no matter what I do, I am not going to be criticized, then you don't have a fear." "We live in a country that we know supports will be favored to one particular side, still if you want to discuss that it's intentional but it's okay please everyone be happy."
