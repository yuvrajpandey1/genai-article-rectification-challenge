## Luxury cars by EU brands might become cheaper in India
### Synopsis
The Indian government is likely to offer some concessions on import duties for high-end cars to the European Union (EU). The move is part of a free trade agreement (FTA) being negotiated between the two parties, government officials told Moneycontrol. At present, India's import duty on completely built-up (CBU) passenger vehicles is 100% for cars costing over €50,000, and 60% for those up to €50,000.

## India working on duty reduction framework for EU
### Duty reduction
The EU has raised concerns over the high import duty on its cars. The issue was also raised by Germany, home to global brands like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi. In response, India is working on a nuanced duty reduction framework for the EU's automotive sector. This framework will be similar to what was offered to the United Kingdom (UK). However, the final outcome will depend on further negotiations between both sides.

## India-EU FTA talks ongoing
### Negotiation progress
The 13th round of trade talks between India and the EU began today and will continue throughout the week. The next round of negotiations will take place in Geneva next month. Both parties are hopeful to finalize the FTA by December this year.

## What does India-UK trade deal say about luxury cars?
### Tariff reduction
Under its FTA with the UK, signed on May 6, India will gradually reduce import duties on automobiles. The reduction will be based on engine capacity and vehicle price. For example, for electric vehicles (EV) CBUs with a duty of 110%, the India-UK trade agreement has lowered import tariffs to 30% from the first year. These levies will further decrease to 10% from the fifth year.

The luxury car segment, which accounts for less than 2% of the total passenger vehicle (PV) volumes in India, is dominated by German brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW, with the former clocking sales of 18,928 units in FY25 and the latter following at 15,266 units.
