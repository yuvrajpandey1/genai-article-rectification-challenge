## Popstar sparked concern after posting strange video last month
### Social media scrutiny
Last month, the 41-year-old country singer sparked concern among fans after posting a strange video of herself dancing in her cluttered home in Nashville, Tennessee, where the floor appeared to be covered in dog poop and cigarette butts. In the videos, she sang and danced to Rihanna's 2004 hit Unfaithful and Michael Jackson's Kiss, while speaking in a Southern accent and wearing a floral nightgown. Despite disabling comments on her posts, fans expressed their worries on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), with several followers publicly calling for an immediate intervention.

E! News confirmed a statement from Spears' rep regarding the posts.

## Her conservatorship ended in November 2021
### Post-conservatorship life
In November 2021, Spears famously ended her 13-year-long legal conservatorship. Since then, she has been posting more frequently on social media, including snaps of herself in the nude and some of her dancing with sharp knives, and she has released two new singles. These posts have raised eyebrows and sparked discussions about her mental health and well-being.
