## Nepal protests turn deadly; Manisha Koirala calls it 'black day'
### Synopsis
Nepal's recent protests against corruption and a government ban on social media platforms have turned deadly, with at least 20 people killed and over 250 injured. The unrest was sparked by the Nepalese government's decision to block 26 online platforms, including Facebook and YouTube, last week. Now, Bollywood actor Manisha Koirala has condemned the crackdown on demonstrators in her home country, calling it a "black day."

## Protests against government ban on social media
### Protest details
The protests were triggered by the Nepalese government's decision to block 26 social media platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, and X (formerly Twitter). This move was seen as an attempt to regulate platforms that did not comply with a Supreme Court order issued last year concerning online fraud and money laundering. The decision was met with widespread discontent. Before the ban, a "Nepo Kids" trend was rampant, where political leaders' offspring and their extravagant lifestyles were being scrutinized.
