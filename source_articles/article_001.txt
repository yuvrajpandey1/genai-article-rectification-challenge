## iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max Features, Specifications

On the other hand, the new member of the lineup, iPhone 17 Air, gets a titanium body. Apple has moved to a unibody design with a "full-width camera plateau" on the back, completing the new design.

Speaking of new, the iPhone 17 Pro is also first flagship smartphone from the tech giant to feature a vapour chamber cooling system. Apple says it is designed to offer higher sustained performance during demanding workloads. The iPhone 17 Pro features a 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion up to 120Hz, while the 17 Pro Max gets a 6.9-inch display of the same specification. Ceramic Shield 2, which contains a new Apple-designed coating, is said to offer 3x better scratch resistance to the screens. Both devices have a peak outdoor brightness of 3,000nits.

The iPhone 17 Pro models are equipped with the new A19 Pro chipset, paired with the company's new vapour chamber. Apple claims its "most capable" iPhone chip offers up to 40 percent better sustained performance compared to the older generations. It comes with a six-core CPU and a six-core GPU architecture, with each GPU core featuring neural accelerators.

Coming to the cameras, the iPhone 17 Pro models feature a triple rear camera setup with a 48-megapixel primary shooter, a 48-megapixel ultrawide sensor, and a 48-megapixel telephoto lens. This is the first time all three cameras at the back of an iPhone has the same 48-megapixel resolution. The telephoto camera gets the biggest upgrade compared to previous generation's 12-megapixel shooter. Apple says it is 56 percent larger and offers 8x optical zoom and 40 digital zoom. On the front, it comes with an 18-megapixel camera which uses Centre Stage to dynamically frame photos.

The iPhone 17 Pro and the iPhone 17 Pro Max will run on iOS 26 out of the box. The new operating system brings the Liquid Glass user interface to the smartphones as well as new Apple Intelligence features. Users will be able to use artificial intelligence (AI) features such as Live Translation in Messages, FaceTime, and Phone app; upgraded visual intelligence capabilities; as well as new screening tools for calls and messages.

As per the company, the iPhone 17 Pro models get a larger battery due to the unibody design, and the A19 Pro SoC offers higher power efficiency.

# Apple launches iPhone 17 Pro with major camera upgrades

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Apple launched the iPhone 17 Pro and the iPhone 17 Pro Max on Tuesday with a new design and an upgraded camera system.

The devices are powered by the new A19 Pro chipset and have a larger battery, Apple said. Plus, it noted that eSIM-only models will have a slightly larger battery as compared to Pro models with physical SIMs.

The new Pro phones have an aluminium unibody instead of the titanium used in the previous year’s iPhone.

The company said it designed a new vapor chamber thermal system along with the new unibody. Apple is also adding ceramic shield 2 protection on the front and previous-gen ceramic shield on the back.

The company is upgrading the telephoto camera from a 12-megapixel sensor to a 48-megapixel sensor. With the sensor change, users will be able to get an 8x optical zoom. This is one of the highest optical zoom capacities on the market, with the Vivo X200 offering 8.7x optical zoom with its periscope kit.

Apple is offering 40x digital zoom. This is lower than 100x offered by Google or Samsung, but it is not clear if Apple is doing digital regeneration using AI like those companies.

All of this is housed by a new rectangular camera bar covering the entire width of the back of the iPhone, which Apple has chosen to call “plateau.”

The selfie camera is also getting an upgrade from a 12-megapixel to an 18-megapixel sensor. Apple will now also allow for a video recording from both the front and the back camera simultaneously.

The iPhone 17 Pro starts at $1,099, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max starts at $1,199. These devices are available to preorder on Friday and will be available on September 19. Both models now start at 256GB base storage, and the company is also offering a 2TB model for the 17 Pro Max.
