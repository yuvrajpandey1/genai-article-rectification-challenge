Sharing a picture of a blood-soaked shoe on her social media handle, the actress shared a heart-wrenching note in Nepali. "आजको दिन नेपालका लागि कालो दिन हो — जब जनताका आवाजलाई गोलीले जवाफ दिइयो। (Today is a black day for Nepal — when bullets respond to the voice of the people, outrage against corruption and demand for justice)," reads Manisha Koirala’s post.  

The actress also shared several social media stories to spread awareness about the protest. Meanwhile, Nepali actors have also come forward to share their take on the whole situation.

## Manisha Koirala’s connection to Nepal  

Manisha Koirala was born in Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu, on 16 August 1970. Her family was a prominent part of Nepal’s politics. When Manisha made her way to acting, she started her career with a Nepali film 'Pheri Bhetaula'.

Reportedly, the protest started after the government of Nepal blocked 26 unregistered social media platforms. This includes Facebook, YouTube, and X (formerly Twitter). The decision was made to regulate the platforms that failed to comply with the Supreme Court’s directive, which was issued last year, raising concerns over online fraud and money laundering. However, this decision didn’t go down well with the young population of Nepal. Reports further add that as the protesters turned violent, security forces opened fire across several districts.

About Nepal protests

At least 20 people were killed and over 250 injured after Nepalese security forces opened fire on demonstrators near the Parliament in Kathmandu on Monday. The protests, which began as digital dissent, were sparked by Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli’s decision to ban 26 social media platforms, a move widely seen as an attempt to stifle dissent amid rising allegations of corruption.

The situation escalated after thousands of young protesters, largely from Gen Z, stormed the Parliament complex. In response, law enforcement used batons, tear gas, and rubber bullets, resulting in violent clashes. As tensions spread across the country, the army was deployed in several cities to restore order.

Curfews were imposed in Kathmandu and other major urban centres, including Birgunj, Bhairahawa, Butwal, Pokhara, Itahari, and Damak. Facing intense political pressure and public outrage, home minister Ramesh Lekhak tendered his resignation, taking moral responsibility for the violence.
