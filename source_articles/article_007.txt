Pakistan’s players lift the trophy and pose proudly in front of the champions’ hoarding. This was a series dictated by teams batting first and it’s been a while since chasing looked this difficult in T20 cricket. The spinners, especially from Afghanistan and Pakistan, made the most of these conditions and will be delighted with their returns. Up next is the Asia Cup, where the surfaces in Dubai and Abu Dhabi are expected to play differently from what we saw here in Sharjah. That’s all from us. This is **Nikhil** signing off, alongside **Sagar** and **Vinod.** Goodbye!

**Salman Agha | Pakistan captain:** I think it was a kind of wicket where 140 was going to be challenging. We knew it was going to be tough for them. He (Nawaz) has been outstanding with the bat, ball and in the field since his comeback. I can go to him when we are in tough situation. We will play two spinners whenever we need. We assess the conditions and playing two spinners worked for us. It was tough for us to play against their spinners. It was always about preparing for Asia Cup. I think we are doing really well as a team. We have ticked most of the boxes, we are in good shape and ready for the Asia Cup.

**Rashid Khan | Afghanistan captain:** That was the kind of total. The wicket was there to chase. We didn't play the brand of cricket we wanted to play. We lost five wickets in the powerplay. I wasn't expecting it to spin so much. It proved to be a different wicket. In T20 cricket you hardly have any time to come back. We got a chance to understand the conditions before the Asia Cup. I think we haven't played much T20 cricket in the last 8-9 months. This has helped us ahead of the Asia Cup, it will help us as a team.

**Mohammad Nawaz | Player of the Series:** The plan was very simple. We knew this pitch was difficult to bat on. We had to be disciplined with our bowling. We hit the right areas and found success. I got spin on the first two balls, I realised the pace on which I had to bowl. I had to keep the pads and stumps in play. I am feeling good. I have control and that has given me the confidence. Just trying to keep things simple and trying to execute. We needed a partnership at that time. We were under pressure but we recovered and got to 140.

**29.5 overs of spin** is the second-most in a Men's T20I featuring two full-member teams, just short of 30 overs between India and New Zealand in Lucknow in 2023.

**22:21 Local Time, 18:21 GMT, 23:51 IST:** A stellar display from Pakistan’s spinners powers them to a thumping win in the grand finale. Shaheen Afridi set the tone early by removing Gurbaz in the very first over, and Afghanistan never truly recovered. Mohammad Nawaz then took charge, spinning a web with four quick wickets that included a sensational hat-trick. Returning later, he dismissed skipper Rashid Khan to complete a memorable five-wicket haul. On a sluggish Sharjah track, it turned into a trial by spin, with Afghanistan folding to a heavy 75-run defeat. The trend of the tri-series was clear as every match was won by the team setting a target, underlining how tough chasing proved to be.
