US ICE agents detained about 475 workers, which included more than 300 South Koreans.

South Korea has pledged full support for the release of its nationals detained in a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai Motor facility in Georgia, even as US President Donald Trump defended the crackdown, describing the workers as “illegal aliens.”

South Korean Presidential chief of staff Kang Hun-sik said on Sunday that a plane would be dispatched to bring back the workers once administrative procedures are completed. “The government will make all-out efforts for their safe return,” Kang said in televised remarks, cited news agency Reuters.

Earlier on Saturday, President Lee Jae Myung had ordered swift action after hundreds of Koreans were arrested in the raid. Foreign minister Cho Hyun confirmed that a special task force had been set up to respond to the detentions and said he was prepared to travel to Washington “if necessary” to negotiate with US officials.

The statement came as several arrests took place on Thursday at a Hyundai Motor car battery plant near Savannah, Georgia. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained about 475 workers, which included more than 300 South Koreans.

## Trump defends ICE action

When asked about the raid, Donald Trump said on Friday: “I would say that they were illegal aliens and ICE was just doing its job.”

The US department of homeland security confirmed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained about 475 workers, including more than 300 South Koreans, in what it described as the largest single-site enforcement operation in its investigative history.

Meanwhile, Hyundai Motor said on Sunday it had dispatched a senior human resources executive to Georgia “to ensure the swift and safe release of those detained.” The company also pledged to review its suppliers and subcontractors to verify compliance with US regulations.

## ‘Regrettable’

Several video footage and photographs showed armed agents supported by helicopters and armored vehicles while workers in Hyundai and LG CNS vests were lined up outside the factory.

Condemning the US government's release of images of the arrest, First Vice Foreign Minister Park Yoon-joo, in a phone call with US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Allison Hooker, called the incident “regrettable.”

A foreign ministry's statement cited by Reuters, said, During the call, Park stressed that the arrests came “at a critical time, when the momentum of trust and cooperation between the two leaders, forged through their first summit, must be maintained.” He also urged Washington to ensure “a fair and swift resolution.”

## US-South Korea ties

The raid comes shortly after Seoul and Washington concluded a trade deal involving a $350 billion fund to support Korean companies entering the US market.

South Korea’s presidential office said on Sunday it would explore reforms to the visa system for Korean workers in the United States to “prevent a similar incident.”

The Republican President may visit South Korea in October to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, CNN reported. The meeting can be an opportunity to reinforce bilateral cooperation amid the fallout from the Hyundai raid.

# US immigration raid an ‘unjust infringement’ on rights of detained South Koreans, country’s president says

Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

Seoul, South Korea —

The detention of hundreds of South Korean nationals after a immigration raid on a factory in Georgia last week was an “unjust infringement” on the rights of South Korean people and businesses operating in the United States, the Asian nation’s president said Tuesday.

Some 300 South Korean nationals were detained – some taken away in handcuffs and leg chains – last Thursday in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid on the Hyundai-LG facility, which is under construction in southern Georgia.

“They must have been greatly shocked by this sudden event,” South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said, adding that he felt “a profound sense of responsibility” for the safety of the Korean citizens.

To that end, hours earlier the government announced that the detained Koreans will return to Incheon International Airport, near the capital Seoul, on a chartered flight later this week following negotiations with the US.

Korean Air on Tuesday confirmed one of the airline’s Boeing 747s will leave South Korea as early as Wednesday and head to Atlanta to assist in the repatriation of the detained South Koreans.

The plane, which will leave carrying no passengers, is capable of accommodating 368 people, a spokesperson for Korean Air said.

The raid last Thursday was one of the largest by US immigration enforcement agencies in recent years. Images of workers, many of them Korean, being shackled and led away into detention have circulated widely across South Korea and sparked criticism at a time when the country is pouring multi-billion-dollar investments into the US, much of it at the behest of US President Donald Trump.

Last month South Korea business heavyweights including Korean Air and Hyundai unveiled multibillion-dollar deals in the US following the summit between the two countries’ leaders.

The plant in Georgia, which is supposed to be operating next year, is a massive investment for the state and projected to employ up to 8,500 people when complete.

But the immigration raid has tarnished those plans.

“I hope that such unjust infringements on the activities of our people and businesses, who contribute to the mutual growth of Korea and the US, will not happen again,” Lee, the South Korean president, said Tuesday.

On Monday, he dispatched Foreign Minister Cho Hyun to Washington, DC, for talks.

What the foreign minister’s role in the repatriation process would be was unclear, but the Lee government was trying to quickly contain simmering discontent in the country about how its nationals were being treated by US law enforcement.

The spokesperson for the opposition People Power Party – a conservative party that usually speaks favorably of the US – called the raid “an unprecedented diplomatic disaster.”

“This is the United States expressing its diplomatic dissatisfaction with South Korea in the strongest possible way,” said spokesperson Song Eon-seog, adding that Lee “must clearly explain where this diplomatic breakdown began.”

Kim Jae-yeon, South Korea’s Progressive Party leader, called the raid “a breach of trust.”

“President Trump should apologize for what happened and promise measures to prevent recurrence,” Kim said.

## ‘Truly painful’

Thursday’s raid was the top story on a range of South Korean newspapers and websites on Monday morning, with stories questioning Washington’s treatment of South Korean nationals and whether business and diplomatic relations could suffer permanent damage.

But the blowback from the raid appears to go deeper than business deals, with some seeing it as an affront to a bilateral friendship forged over more than seven decades since the end of the Korean War in 1953.

“Seeing our own people being mercilessly detained and put into detention centers in a country we regard as a friend was truly painful,” said a visiting professor of business at a South Korean university who asked not to be named.

“This could have been my family, myself, or even my friends, and I felt a strong sense of unfairness,” the professor said.

The images even caused shock among die-hard supporters of the US.

It is not unusual to see conservative protesters in South Korea waving US flags at demonstrations for various causes.

Song Seok-ha, 67, who has been protesting every day for five years near the US Embassy in Seoul to call for a stronger US-South Korea alliance, was concerned about long-term damage to relations.

“I can understand if the US is deporting illegal immigrants, but this time it seemed too extreme… I’m worried this might put a crack in the US-South Korea alliance,” he said.

It’s unclear what kind of visas the Korean nationals working at the plant had. Some of the 475 detained entered the US illegally, according to Steven Schrank, a Homeland Security Investigations special agent in charge, while others had overstayed their visas.

Others were here under the US Visa Waiver Program which allows workers to travel for tourism or business for up to 90 days and had subsequently been prohibited from working.

Georgia immigration attorney Charles Kuck told CNN two of his clients were detained at the raid after having arrived from South Korea under a visa waiver. One client arrived in the US in August, and the other arrived several weeks ago, he said.

While none of the Korean nationals worked for Hyundai, about 50 of them worked for LG Energy Solutions. Another 250 mostly Korean national employees worked for HL-GA Battery Company LLC, which operates under Hyundai and LG.

In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for LG Energy Solution said the company was cooperating with the process: “We will commit our best efforts to ensure the safe and prompt return of our employees and those of our partners.”

When asked Monday about the visa status of the detained workers, the company told CNN, “The visa status of the detained individuals is under investigation, so we don’t know yet.”

CNN has reached out to the State Department, Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Hyundai for comment.

# South Korea wants workers detained in immigration raid to be able to re-enter US

Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

SEOUL (Reuters) – South Korea said on Monday that it wants hundreds of its citizens, who were arrested last week during a large U.S. immigration raid at a car battery project and are due to be flown home soon, to be allowed to re-enter the United States.

Foreign Minister Cho Hyun is flying out to Washington on Monday evening and will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during his trip to resolve the issue. Cho also said he would be asking for the U.S. visa system for Korean workers to be streamlined in the future.

About 300 South Koreans were among 475 arrested on Thursday at the site of a $4.3 billion project by Hyundai Motor and LG Energy Solution to build batteries for electric cars. It was the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of the Department of Homeland Security’s investigative operations.

The raid sent shockwaves through South Korea, a major U.S. ally which has been trying to finalise a U.S. trade deal agreed in late July. It came just 10 days after South Korea’s new president, Lee Jae Myung, met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington and the two pledged closer business ties.

In addition to potentially fraying bilateral ties, the development has shone fresh light on how many foreign firms investing in the U.S. have struggled to find qualified American workers.

Seoul said on Sunday that discussions to arrange the release of workers, who were mostly employed by subcontractors, were largely concluded. A plan is in the works to fly them home on a chartered plane this week under what one South Korean foreign ministry official said would be called a “voluntary departure”.

“From the beginning, we negotiated with the premise that there should be no personal disadvantage (to the detained workers),” Cho told a parliamentary hearing on Monday.

Details on how the workers may have breached immigration rules have not been released by authorities or the companies, but South Korean lawmakers on Monday said some may have overstepped the boundaries of a 90-day visa waiver programme or a B-1 temporary business visa.

South Korea Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol said on Monday that he had heard that some experts had travelled from South Korea to help with a test run of the factory which was due to begin production in October.

“You need to get a visa to do a test run, but it’s very difficult to get an official visa. Time was running out, and I think experts went to the United States,” he said.

DISMAY IN SOUTH KOREA

Seoul has expressed its unhappiness about the arrests and the public release of footage showing the operation which involved armoured vehicles and the shackling of workers.

Trump, who has ramped up deportations nationwide as his administration cracks down on illegal immigrants, said last week he had not been aware of the raid. He called those detained “illegal aliens”.

On Sunday, he called on foreign companies investing in the U.S. to “respect our Nation’s immigration laws”, but sounded more conciliatory.

“Your Investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people, with great technical talent, to build World Class products, and we will make it quickly and legally possible for you to do so,” he said on Truth Social.

Hyundai Motor is one of the biggest foreign investors in the United States and is among South Korean companies participating in a pledge of $150 billion in foreign direct investment in the U.S., which comes on top of a $350 billion fund that the South Korean government has separately pledged.

A spokesperson for the automaker said some staff had been asked to suspend non-essential trips to the United States.

LGES has also suspended most staff business trips to the U.S. and will be recalling South Korea-based employees now in the country.

The battery maker said last week it is cooperating with U.S. authorities and had paused construction work on the factory.

A Hyundai Motor spokesperson said last week none of the people detained were employed directly by the automaker and that production of electric vehicles at the sprawling site was not affected.

The companies declined further comment on Monday.

Cho’s trip to the U.S. is due to end on Wednesday.
