Ahead of entering the police station, Vedan told the media that he would fully cooperate with the investigation. He, however, refused to comment further on the case.

Vedan was earlier booked by the Thrikkakara police based on a complaint filed by a woman doctor who accused him of sexually abusing her on the pretext of a false marriage promise.

The Ernakulam Central police have also registered a case against Vedan based on a complaint by a woman music researcher. In that case, he has been slapped with Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which deals with the offence of using assault or criminal force against a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty, according to the police.
