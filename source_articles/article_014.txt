## India vs UAE Key battles:

### Shubman Gill vs Junaid Siddique

India's vice captain in the Asia Cup 2025, Shubman Gill, would hope to get off to a good start, having not played a T20I game for India for more than a year. Gill will be up against Junaid Siddique, who will take the new ball for the UAE and will be entrusted with the responsibility of picking wickets with the new ball.

### Suryakumar Yadav vs Haider Ali

The captain of India in T20I cricket, Suryakumar Yadav, would like to start the tournament on the right note both as a leader and as a batter. Surya will face the challenge of Haider Ali, who will look to pick wickets in the middle overs for the UAE and restrict the flow of runs by doing so.

### Muhammad Waseem vs Jasprit Bumrah

UAE's captain and opening batter Muhammad Waseem would wish to lead from the front and get a big score under his belt. Waseem will go head-to-head against Jasprit Bumrah, who has the reputation of picking wickets in all three phases of the game and would aim to do the same.

### Alishan Sharafu vs Varun Chakaravarthy

Alishan Sharafu, who is expected to be the other opening batter for the UAE, would like to play in his usual aggressive manner in the first six overs. Sharafu will have to tackle the bowling of Varun Chakaravarthy, who can bowl with the new ball in the powerplay along with the middle and final five overs when the ball gets soft.

As far as the UAE is concerned, the Muhammad Waseem-led side would back itself to give India a tough competition in all three departments of the game.
