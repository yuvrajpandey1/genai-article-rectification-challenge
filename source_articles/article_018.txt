# Nepal Army to take charge after PM, key ministers resign as protests spiral

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Nepal was plunged deeper into political turmoil on Tuesday as Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli stepped down amid massive protests that have rocked the Himalayan nation. The political crisis has prompted the Nepali Army to step in to maintain order and safeguard the nation.

Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, Agriculture Minister Ramnath Adhikari, Youth and Sports Minister Teju Lal Chaudhary, and Water Minister Pradeep Yadav are among the leaders who have resigned so far.

The resignation came as demonstrators, largely driven by Gen Zers' anger over social media ban and corruption and nepotism, continue to defy curfews and clash with security forces. The unrest was triggered by Oli’s controversial ban on social media platforms last week, which was rolled back in the wee hours of Tuesday after protests turned deadly.

Meanwhile, the Nepalese Army, in a statement, indicated that it is taking charge of the security situation in the absence of political leadership.

The army said it is "fully committed to discharging its constitutional responsibility of safeguarding national independence, sovereignty, geographical integrity, national unity, and the security of the Nepali people." It also "sincerely appeals to all, especially the youth, to play a constructive role in maintaining social harmony, peace, and national unity during these difficult circumstances."

The unrest in Nepal has claimed at least 22 lives so far, while hundreds have been injured in the violence that began on Monday and continued unabated on Tuesday.

In his resignation letter, Oli said he was stepping aside “in view of the adverse situation in the country” and to enable a political solution under the constitution.

While jubilant protesters celebrated outside parliament, violence and arson persisted in parts of Kathmandu. Witnesses said several politicians’ homes were set ablaze, including Oli’s private residence, while the Singha Durbar complex housing key ministries was also torched. Kathmandu airport was shut down as fires nearby raised safety concerns.

The protests, described by organisers as a “Gen Z movement,” have spread across cities, fuelled by anger at systemic graft and widening inequality. Young Nepalis accuse politicians of enjoying lavish lifestyles while offering little by way of jobs or economic security.

Just hours before his resignation, Oli had appealed for restraint, saying, “Any form of violence is not in the national interest. We must adopt peaceful dialogue and discussion.” According to army sources, Oli had earlier sought military assistance from Nepal Army Chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel to secure his safe exit. The Army Chief reportedly advised him to step down, warning that the military could only stabilise the situation if he relinquished power. Some sources even claimed Oli was preparing to flee to Dubai.

Meanwhile, violence and arson persisted across Kathmandu. Protesters vandalised and set fire to the Parliament complex and the Singha Durbar area housing key ministries. Local media showed visuals of thick smoke rising from the Parliament building. The private residences of both Oli and President Poudel were also attacked.

Security operations were ramped up, with around a dozen helicopters evacuating officials from ministerial quarters in Bhaisepati to Tribhuvan International Airport, according to army sources. At least five army helicopters transported key ministers before the airport was shut down and flights cancelled.

Nepal has struggled with political instability ever since scrapping its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008. In the years since, the country has seen 14 different governments, none of which managed to serve a complete five-year term. Oli, now 73, had taken office for the fourth time just last year.
