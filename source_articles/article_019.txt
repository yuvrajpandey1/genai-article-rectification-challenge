# Exclusive: Salman Khan to shoot Battle of Galwan climax scenes in first schedule

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Salman Khan is currently shooting the important climax sequences of his film, 'Battle of Galwan', in Leh and Ladakh. The production aims to complete key scenes quickly due to unpredictable weather, ensuring high-quality visuals and authenticity.

Salman Khan is gearing up for one of the most crucial shooting schedules of his highly awaited film, 'Battle of Galwan'. The team is set to film the climax sequences in Leh and Ladakh over the next 2-3 weeks. According to industry sources, the production is prioritising these pivotal scenes to avoid disruption caused by the region’s erratic weather conditions.

“Galwan’s climax is among the most important parts of the film, both visually and emotionally. Given Leh and Ladakh’s unpredictable weather, the makers want to ensure the quality of these sequences is not compromised. That is why they are planning to complete as much as possible during this schedule itself,” a source informed.

Directed by Apoorva Lakhia, 'Battle of Galwan' is touted as one of Salman Khan’s most ambitious projects in recent years. The film is based on the 2020 clash between Indian and Chinese forces in the Galwan valley.

The Ladakh schedule, particularly the grand climax, is expected to involve high-octane action set pieces, mounted on an international scale. With vast landscapes, shifting terrains, and the complexities of shooting at high altitude, the production is leaving no stone unturned to get the authenticity right.

Meanwhile, Salman is also balancing his commitments to Bigg Boss 19, where he continues to serve as the show’s iconic host. The actor is said to be working around a tight schedule to manage both the film’s demands and his television obligations.
