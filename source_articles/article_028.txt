# Akasa Air launches ‘Lock Your Fare’ service letting flyers freeze ticket prices before booking

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Akasa Air announced on Tuesday that it has introduced a new booking feature called ‘Lock Your Fare’, giving passengers the option to hold on to ticket prices for a specific period before confirming their purchase. 

The service, available exclusively through the airline’s website and mobile app, comes with a small fee and is designed to give travellers more control over planning their trips, the company said in a press release. 

For domestic flights, the fare-lock option can be used up to seven days before the scheduled departure, with the possibility of holding the fare for as long as 15 days.

On the other hand, on international routes, the feature is available until 15 days before departure, and passengers can keep the fare reserved for up to a week. 

"This launch underscores Akasa Air’s commitment to delivering meaningful, customer-centric solutions and making air travel accessible and affordable," the company said in the release. 

The idea is to shield passengers from sudden fare hikes, a common concern for those planning holidays, business trips or group travel that require coordination. By allowing extra time before completing the purchase, Akasa is positioning the tool as a way to make air travel decisions with less urgency and greater flexibility. 

"With ‘Lock Your Fare', customers are protected from fare hikes, ensuring that they can secure the best pricing available with the convenience of completing their purchase at their own pace," Akasa Air added.
