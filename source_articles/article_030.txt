# Fungus on hands, smelly clothes, can't live in jail: Darshan asks judge for poison

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Actor Darshan, accused in the Renukaswamy murder case in Karnataka, pleaded with the judge to give him poison, citing unbearable jail conditions. The judge refused his request.

During the monthly hearing of the Renukaswamy murder case, actor Darshan appeared before the 64th City Civil and Sessions Court, Hall (CCH) via video conference from jail and complained about the conditions he is facing.

Darshan told the judge that he had not seen sunlight for many days, his hands had developed fungus, and his clothes smelled. “I can’t live like this anymore. Please, just give me poison. Life here has become unbearable,” he said.

The actor added that he could not survive in the present situation. “Please give poison at least to me. I don’t want to continue like this,” he said.

The judge responded by saying, “Such things cannot be done. That is not possible.”

Darshan was arrested in June 2024 in connection with the abduction and murder of 33-year-old Renukaswamy, a fan from Chitradurga. Police allege that Renukaswamy had sent obscene messages to Pavithra Gowda, a close associate of Darshan, which led to him being abducted, tortured in a shed in Bengaluru, and later found dead in a drain.

The actor was initially granted bail by the Karnataka High Court in December 2024, but the Supreme Court cancelled it on August 14, 2025, citing serious concerns over witness tampering and ordering that he not receive any special treatment in custody. Darshan was subsequently re-arrested and remains in judicial custody.

The court also heard discharge petitions from accused numbers 13 and 14 and fixed September 19 as the date for framing charges. Darshan’s plea to avoid transfer to Ballari prison and his request for a bed and mattress have been adjourned to 3 pm.

# 'Fungal infection, haven't seen sun': Jailed actor Darshan asks court for poison; judge retorts

A court in Bengaluru on Tuesday rejected actor Darshan’s request to be transferred from Parappana Agrahara Central Prison to Ballari jail.

Jailed Kannada actor Darshan reportedly appealed before a city court in Karnataka's Bengaluru on Tuesday to give him “poison” as his jail transfer request was rejected amid his deteriorating health condition.

Darshan cited fungal infection in hands and no sight of sun since 30 days during the hearing, according to a PTI news agency report.

The court in Bengaluru on Tuesday rejected Darshan’s request to be transferred from Parappana Agrahara Central Prison to Ballari jail in connection with the Renukaswamy murder case.

The case pertains to the death of a man named Renukaswamy, a fan who allegedly sent obscene messages to actress Pavithra, a close associate of Darshan.

Darshan, along with Pavithra Gowda and several others, is accused of abducting and torturing 33-year-old Renukaswamy.

## **‘Just poison me’**

As the court found no valid grounds for the transfer request to be granted, Darshan told the judge, "Just poison me, please pass this order" and triggered a sharp response. The judge admonished him and instructed him not to repeat the statement, according to the PTI report.

The court allowed Darshan concessions within the prison, permitting him to walk within the prison premises.

Darshan, in his appeal during the hearing on Tuesday, said he had not seen the sun for 30 days and that his hands were affected by a fungal infection.

The court also approved his plea for basic facilities, including an extra bed, pillow, and bedsheet, while emphasising that all provisions must comply with the prison manual.

The court warned that any violation of rules would empower the Inspector General of Prisons to take disciplinary action, including transferring the inmate.
