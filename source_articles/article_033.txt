# Why Nepal govt imposed social media ban that sparked stunning protests: Explained

Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

Sites and apps including Facebook and YouTube went dark last week as the companies that own them failed to comply with new local registration rules.

The stunning protests in Nepal that claimed multiple lives on Monday come after the government directed internet service providers to block access to several major social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and X, last week.

The sites and apps went dark starting September 5 as the companies that own them failed to comply with new local registration rules. Younger citizens using the term ‘Gen Z’ for their collective called for protests.

What does Nepal govt want from social media apps?

It was on Thursday that Nepal's ministry for communication and information technology asked the regulating authority to instruct service providers to restrict access to 26 platforms.

The list included Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, YouTube, X, Discord, Reddit, WeChat and Snapchat.

These are all foreign platforms, who were given seven days to register their operations in Nepal and appoint a local contact person.

The Nepal Supreme Court had also upheld the government requirement, citing the need to regulate revenues and address misinformation. The court did not call for a ban as such, though. It directed the government to create the required legal arrangements.

The registration rules come ahead of a proposed wider legislation on the issue.

Debates are on over the social media bill that could introduce fines and imprisonment for content deemed “against national interest”.

The bill has drawn criticism, for it is seen as a threat to press freedom and digital expression. The government claims it does not intend to restrict free speech.

How wide is the extent of Nepal social media ban?

Data from the Nepal Telecommunications Authority says over 90 per cent of Nepal has internet. Facebook is the most used social media platform with 87 per cent market share, HT has reported citing figures from Statcounter. The platform X, earlier called Twitter, has 6 per cent share, followed by YouTube.

Some civil society groups have compared it to censorship in China.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said the decision would hinder the ability of the news media to report, thus limiting democratic access to information. The Federation of Nepali Journalists also described the measure as undermining citizens’ rights. Several journalists were among those injured in police action at the protests.

But Nepal's communication and IT minister, Prithvi Subba Gurung, has said platforms were given enough time to register. Meta, Google and Snap did not respond to requests for comment.

The Nepal government says access to apps would be restored once they register.

TikTok and Viber are among those that remain unaffected, for they have completed the registration.

# Nepal’s ‘Gen Z' revolution: How a social media shutdown sparked a nationwide youth protest | Explained

Nepal is witnessing its biggest youth-led protests in years as thousands of young people flood Kathmandu demanding an end to corruption and the lifting of a sweeping social media ban. What began online has spilled into the streets, with demonstrators surrounding Parliament and clashing with police. Security forces have opened fire at multiple locations, leaving one protester dead and more than 80 injured.

Protesters accuse Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s government of “curbing free speech” and “ignoring public concerns,” and the turmoil has been further fuelled by a rare public address from former King Gyanendra, whose words emboldened calls for a return to monarchy and even revival of a Hindu Rashtra.

**The spark: A ban on social media platforms**

The immediate trigger was the Oli government’s decision on September 4 to block 26 major platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, X, LinkedIn, Signal and YouTube. The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology said the companies had been given seven days from August 28 to register in Nepal, establish a point of contact, and designate compliance and grievance officers. When the deadline expired without compliance, the government imposed a blanket shutdown.

The ministry claimed the move was about regulatory compliance. But rights groups and businesses denounced it as an assault on democracy and economic freedoms. Protesters see it as a direct act of censorship aimed at suppressing critical voices and organised dissent.

**How the movement grew**

Although the government imposed phone and internet blackouts, digital-savvy Gen Z activists turned to alternative platforms such as TikTok and Reddit to mobilise. Thousands of demonstrators gathered at Maitighar Mandala before marching toward the Parliament building, chanting slogans against corruption and the social media ban. Waving national flags, they began their protest with the national anthem before unleashing chants against the prohibitions.

Videos circulating online showed tear gas canisters arcing through the air as demonstrators hurled branches and water bottles at police. Many breached restricted zones and broke through police barricades. Some protesters managed to enter the Parliament compound, prompting authorities to impose a curfew covering the Parliament area and other key locations in the capital.

**Voices from the streets**

The protest movement is not just about the ban but also about deeper frustration with corruption and inequality. “We were triggered by the social media ban but that is not the only reason we are gathered here,” said student Yujan Rajbhandari, 24. “We are protesting against corruption that has been institutionalised in Nepal.”

Another student, Ikshama Tumrok, 20, said she was protesting against the “authoritarian attitude” of the government. “We want to see change. Others have endured this, but it has to end with our generation,” she told AFP.

Since the ban, TikTok has become a rallying space where videos contrasting the struggles of ordinary Nepalis with the children of politicians flaunting luxury goods and expensive vacations have gone viral. “There have been movements abroad against corruption and they (the government) are afraid that might happen here as well,” said protester Bhumika Bharati.

**Oli’s defence of the ban**

Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has doubled down on the government’s decision. Speaking at a convention of the ruling Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), he said the party would “always stand against anomalies and arrogance, and never accept any act that weakens the nation.”

“Any attempt to undermine the nation can never be tolerated,” he asserted. “The independence of the nation is greater than the loss of jobs of a handful of individuals. How can it be acceptable to defy the law, disregard the constitution, and disrespect national dignity, independence, and sovereignty,” he said.

The government also issued a statement on Sunday saying it respected freedom of thought and expression and was committed to “creating an environment for their protection and unfettered use.”

Nepal has restricted access to popular online platforms before. In July the government blocked access to Telegram citing a rise in online fraud and money laundering. It lifted a nine-month ban on TikTok in August last year after the platform agreed to comply with Nepali regulations. The current clampdown is by far the largest, affecting platforms with millions of Nepali users who rely on them for entertainment, news and business.

# Kathmandu in turmoil: Why Nepal’s Gen-Z has taken to the streets

Social media apps went dark last week following the government's order. The outrage that followed has since grow into a larger movement against corruption.

The protests in Nepal that led to chaos and multiple deaths in capital Kathmandu on Monday came after the government's decision to ban 26 social media platforms, including widely used apps such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, Reddit and Snapchat, for not registering under new rules.

The government led by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli argues that the rules are an effort to tax the revenue these apps generate in Nepal.

But critics stress that the government wants to control content critical of it. TikTok is being cited by protesters as an example of what could happen: thousands of posts allegedly removed on government directions.

When did Nepal social media ban come into effect?

Following the order from the government after a deadline to register passed, the social media apps and sites went dark past midnight on September 4.

Online outrage and peaceful demonstrations followed but did not broker a reversal. The anger did not take long to grow into a larger movement against corruption in general in the country.

The Nepal central government says it took action against the apps after issuing repeated warnings.

It wants them to open offices in Nepal, following a cabinet decision last month that set a deadline. An August 17 Supreme Court ruling also required the social media companies to register and pay requisite taxes.

Which apps have registered under Nepal's new rules?

Platforms that remained accessible include Viber, TikTok, Wetalk and Nimbuzz, which are registered in Nepal. Telegram and Global Diary are in the process, reports said.

But Meta-owned Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp have yet to initiate registration.

Some social media platforms that were already paying taxes in Nepal, despite not being officially registered, have also been blocked, ANI reported.

Nepal IT minister Prithvi Subba Gurung earlier said platforms had been given ample time to register. Meta, Google and Snap did not respond to requests for comment by news outlets.

How protest against Nepal social media ban grew

Matters escalated on Monday after social media users, simply calling themselves ‘Gen-Z’ (a term used for those born around the turn of the millennium), called for a nationwide protest.

Leaflets and posts had earlier called for people to gather near the parliament in the capital. The protesters accuse the government of stifling free expression while failing to address deep-seated corruption.

Nepali artists, actors, and entertainers voiced their support too.

Actor Hari Bansha Acharya posted on Facebook: "Today's youth do more than just think – they ask questions. Why did this road collapse? Who is accountable? This is not a voice against the system but against those who misuse it."

Singer-actor Prakash Saput publicly supported the protestors by sending NRs 25,000 each to two brothers participating in the protests, advising them to stay hydrated and use the funds to help fellow demonstrators, _The Kathmandu Post_ reported.
