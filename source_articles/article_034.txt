# Supertramp singer and co-writer Rick Davies dies at 81

Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

Supertramp founder Rick Davies, who wrote and sang some of the rock band's hits, has died at the age of 81.

The English vocalist and keyboardist died on Saturday, a decade after being diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, the band said.

"As co-writer, along with partner Roger Hodgson, he was the voice and pianist behind Supertramp's most iconic songs, leaving an indelible mark on rock music history," a statement said. "His soulful vocals and unmistakable touch on the Wurlitzer became the heartbeat of the bands' sound."

Davies wrote songs including 1974's Bloody Well Right, their US chart breakthrough; and 1979's Goodbye Stranger.

Born in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 1944, Davies started off in a series of bands including one called The Joint. They didn't make it big but did attract the support of Dutch millionaire Stanley August Miesegaes, who offered to back Davies if he started a new group.

So Davies put an advert for new bandmates in Melody Maker magazine in 1969, and Supertramp were born, with funding from Miesegaes for their first few years.

Davies shared writing and vocals with Hodgson, and the band found chart success with their third album, Crime of the Century, in 1974.

They made it big in the USA five years later with the album Breakfast In America, which included hit singles The Logical Song and the title track, as well as Goodbye Stranger.

The LP sold more than 30 million copies worldwide and was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 1980, including album of the year.

Relations between the two frontmen soured, however, and Hodgson left the group in 1983.

Davies continued to record and tour with Supertramp. They announced a reunion tour in 2015, but it was cancelled when Davies was diagnosed with cancer.

"Beyond the stage, Rick was known for his warmth, resilience, and devotion to his wife Sue, with whom he shared over five decades," the band added in their statement.

"After facing serious health challenges, which kept him unable to continue touring as Supertramp, he enjoyed performing with his hometown buds as Ricky and the Rockets.

"Rick's music and legacy continue to inspire many and bears testament to the fact that great songs never die, they live on."

Supertramp's classic line-up also included bassist Dougie Thomson, saxophonist John Helliwell and drummer Bob Siebenberg.

In 1977, Davies and Hodgson agreed to reduce their 50% share of songwriting royalties in order to give the trio and the band's manager a cut - a move Hodgson said was intended "to keep the band functioning and happy".

That arrangement lasted until 2018, and Thomson, Helliwell and Siebenberg sued Hodgson and Davies in 2021.

Davies settled out of court in 2023. Last month, a US appeals court ruled that Hodgson must share royalties with his ex-bandmates.

# Rick Davies dead at 81: Supertramp founding member and 'Give a Little Bit' songwriter dies

Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

Rick Davies, founding member and primary songwriter of the progressive rock band Supertramp, died Friday, September 5, at his Long Island home following a prolonged battle with cancer. He was 81 years old.

The band announced Davies' death in a public statement, offering condolences to his widow, Sue Davies, whom he married in 1977.

Davies founded Supertramp in 1970 alongside fellow singer and songwriting partner Roger Hodgson. The duo assembled the band's classic lineup from 1973 to 1983, recruiting Dougie Thomson, Bob Siebenberg, and John Helliwell.

During this decade-long period, Supertramp achieved commercial success with multiple hit songs that defined their sound and established Davies as a prominent songwriter in progressive rock.

Davies shared writing credits on several of Supertramp's most recognizable tracks, including "Give a Little Bit" and "Breakfast in America." The band also produced other notable songs during this era, such as "The Logical Song" and "Take the Long Way Home."

These compositions helped establish Supertramp as a significant force in 1970s and early 1980s popular music, with Davies' keyboard skills and songwriting contributing substantially to the band's distinctive sound.

Roger Hodgson departed Supertramp in 1982 following the release of "Famous Last Words" to pursue a solo career. Davies continued leading the remaining members until 1988, when the original formation disbanded.

The band reunited periodically over subsequent decades. In 2015, Supertramp planned a 25-date European tour, but was forced to cancel due to Davies' health issues, including a diagnosis of plasma cell cancer.

Supertramp received four Grammy nominations during their career, including Album of the Year recognition for "Breakfast in America" in 1980. The band achieved particular commercial success in Canada, where two albums reached diamond certification status.

Davies' contributions to Supertramp's catalog helped the band sell millions of records worldwide and maintain a lasting influence on progressive rock and pop music.

Rick Davies married Sue Davies in 1977, and the couple remained together until his death on Friday. The band's statement emphasized their condolences to Sue Davies during this period.

Davies' death marks the end of an era for Supertramp fans and represents a significant loss for the progressive rock community that appreciated his musical contributions spanning more than four decades.
