#### Rashid is to Afghanistan what Sachin was to India: Harsha Bhogle

That's it from all of us. Tomorrow we have India taking on UAE. We will be there for it nice and early. Do join us then. For now sleep tight and take care. Bye bye.

**Rashid Khan:** Was a great game. Good to put total on the board. Wickets early on is the key for us. We had the same issue in the last series. That's one area we need to improve. Batting in the death overs was a great effort. Specially, Omarzai. We have good spinners. It puts pressure on the opposition. When you put runs on the board, batters will take risks and we have a chance to pick wickets. We will try to have a good record while chasing as well. Tough ask to see what is the playing XI. To keep Mujeeb out, it was a tough call. You sometimes look for combinations. The good thing is I have options and that makes it easier for me.

**Yasim Murtaza:** Just feels like dream come true (On playing the Asia Cup). It is one of the biggest tournament of Asia. To be honest, we weren't expecting that kind of total. I was expecting 150. Credit to Omarzai, he changed the game. Babar Hayat with the bat and the spinners were positives from the game.

**Azmatullah Omarzai, Player of the Match:** Very tough batting in the lower order. It is all about belief. The captain and coach have belief in me. Was trying to hit it straight. We lost early wickets. I was speaking to Atal that we will go for boundaries after the 16th over. When I get the ball, I feel am a proper bowler. When I get to bat, I feel am a proper batter (smiles).

**22:26 Local Time, 18:26 GMT, 23:56 IST:** A good workout for Afghanistan and they begin their campaign with a big win. As was expected of them. Chasing 189, HKC were never in the game and only Hayat impressed with a few meaty sixes. Afghanistan were sloppy early on as they dropped two catches but they were never in danger of being threatened by HKC. Afghanistan treated this game as a good practice for their bowlers and they used 7 of them. Only Rashid and Noor completed their quota with the others chipping in. A thumping win for Afghanistan and a good learning experience for HKC. Stay tuned for the post-match stuff...

Gulbadin to Ehsan Khan, 1 run, big shape back in on that low full-toss on off, Ehsan Khan walks into the flick and it's a thick inside-edge on the flick, gets it down to deep backward square-leg. Gulbadin is appealing for LBW but that clearly hit the bat
