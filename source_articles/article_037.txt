Nepal’s Home Minister Ramesh Lal Lekhak has resigned, taking moral responsibility for the deaths during violent protests in Kathmandu. He informed party leaders of his decision during a meeting at President Sher Bahadur Deuba’s residence on Monday evening.

Home Minister Lekhak submitted his resignation to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli during a Cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister’s residence in Baluwatar, citing moral responsibility for the violence.

“There was a huge loss of human lives in today’s protest. I have to take moral responsibility for that, and I will not sit in the post on moral grounds,” Lekhak told OnlineKhabar.

The protests erupted after the government banned major social media platforms, including Facebook, X and YouTube, over state registration rules. Tens of thousands of demonstrators demanded an end to the social media restrictions and an end to the country’s widespread corruption.

The unrest turned deadly, with at least 19 protesters killed and more than 250 injured. Police used water cannons, tear gas, and rubber bullets, while demonstrators clashed with security forces, set motorcycles on fire, and stormed barricades near the parliament. Some protesters even climbed the walls of restricted areas, escalating tensions.

Ranjana Nepal, an information officer at the nearby Civil Hospital, said the emergency ward was overwhelmed with injured protesters. In response, the district administration imposed curfews around key areas, including the parliament, the president’s residence, and Singha Durbar, the prime minister’s office.

# Nepal Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak resigns after 19 killed in 'Gen Z' protests over corruption, social media ban

Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

Nepal Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak resigned on Monday after 19 people were killed and over 100 others injured during violent protests by 'Gen Z' over corruption and social media ban.

“Nepal Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak tenders his resignation to the Prime Minister during the cabinet meeting held at the official residence of the Prime Minister in Baluwatar,” _ANI_ reported.

This comes after thousands of youths protested in Kathmandu and other parts of the country over September 4 ban on 26 social media sites, including Facebook, WhatsApp and X. The demonstration turned violent after some entered the Parliament complex, leading the police to resort to baton charges to disperse the crowd. It also fired tear gas shells and rubber bullets.

The Nepal's government believes the companies missed the deadline to register under new regulations, amid the crackdown on misuse. It stated social media users create bogus IDs and use them to spread hate speech and fake news, commit fraud and other crimes on these platforms.

## Who was Nepal Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak?

Lekhak, 61, a member of the Nepali Congress party, was elected to the Pratinidhi Sabha in the 1999, 2008, and 2013 elections. He has also held the position of Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport of Nepal. He was elected to the 2nd Federal Parliament of Nepal, representing the Kanchanpur-3 constituency in the 2022 Nepalese general election.

Meanwhile, the army was mobilised and a curfew is in place.

“Stop the ban on social media, stop corruption not social media,” the Gen Z, (people born between 1995 and 2010) chanted. TikTok, which was banned in 2023 for disrupting “social harmony, goodwill and diffusing indecent materials” and lifted last year, continues to operate without hinderance there.

Chief District Officer Chhabi Lal Rijal said in a notice stated, “No movement of people, demonstration, meeting, gathering or sit-in will be allowed in the restricted zone." The curfew consists of numerous high-security zones, such as the President's residence (Shital Niwas), the vice-president's residence in Lainchaur, Maharajgunj, all sides of Singha Durbar, the prime minister's residence in Baluwatar, and nearby areas, according to The Kathmandu Post.

# Gen Z protests: Nepal government lifts ban on social media after 19 killed, 300 injured

The Nepal government rolled back its decision to ban social media platforms after days of violent youth-led protests that left at least 19 people dead and more than 300 injured.

Minister for Communication, Information and Broadcasting Prithvi Subba Gurung said the reversal was decided at an emergency Cabinet meeting. “The Ministry of Information has ordered the concerned agencies to start the process of resuming the social media sites as per the demands of the ‘Gen Z’,” he announced.

Just three days earlier, the government had ordered a ban on 26 platforms — including Facebook and X — for failing to register with authorities. The move sparked massive demonstrations in Kathmandu, spearheaded by young protesters.

On Monday, the agitation escalated when demonstrators breached the Parliament complex, prompting police to deploy water cannons, tear gas and even live rounds to disperse the crowd, according to eyewitnesses.

The minister appealed to the protesting groups to call off their agitation in light of the government’s decision. Meanwhile, Facebook, X and WhatsApp were restored by Monday night, bringing major social media sites back online across Nepal.

Earlier, Nepal’s Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak resigned on Monday evening following deadly protests in the Himalayan nation, citing moral responsibility for the loss of lives during demonstrations.

During a cabinet meeting, Lekhak submitted his resignation to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, citing the violent suppression of demonstrators earlier in the day, which resulted in multiple casualties killing at least 19 people.

Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has refused to lift the social media ban, insisting in a Cabinet meeting that the decision stands and must be publicly supported by all ministers, reported India Today.

The move triggered tensions, as Nepali Congress ministers in the ruling coalition demanded the ban be revoked and walked out in protest after Oli dismissed critics as “Gen Z troublemakers.” In response to the escalating rift, Oli has called an emergency meeting of the ruling coalition.

PM Oli has decided to form an investigative committee to probe the incidents during the protests.

Earlier in the day, the Nepal government spokesperson Prithvi Subba Gurung has also been reported to say that the discussions are underway to reconsider the decision to ban social media and that the issue will be discussed during a cabinet meeting called by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.

Gurung, who is also the Communications Minister said, “The government’s decisions are not more important than the lives of the people." “The lives of our people are the most important thing. If the decisions made by the government need to be reconsidered in terms of policy, there is no point in us remaining steadfast".

According to The Himalayan Times, the death toll from the protests has climbed to 19, while more than 345 people have been injured across Nepal.

The report citing hospital officials said at least 17 died in different hospitals in Kathmandu alone–8 people died at the National Trauma Centre, 3 at Everest Hospital, 3 at Civil Hospital, 2 at Kathmandu Medical College, and 1 at Tribhuvan Teaching Hospital.

In Sunsari, 2 protesters shot during demonstrations in Itahari also succumbed to injuries, taking the nationwide toll to 19. Hospitals across the country are treating at least 347 injured protesters.

Those injured include Gen Z protesters, security personnel, and journalists, the report said.

This move to ban 26 social media sites follows a Supreme Court order and a recent ministerial meeting led by Prithvi Subba Gurung.

The police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters who tried to break into parliament.

Thousands of young Nepali people, many in their 20s or even younger, got together to protest in the capital Kathmandu and other cities in the Himalayan country. Many of the protesters were students and joined the demonstrations in their school or college uniforms. The organisers called the protests "demonstrations by Gen Z".

Last week, Nepal's government blocked access to several social media platforms after the companies missed the deadline to register under new regulations aimed at cracking down on misuse.

Nepal's government has said social media users create fake IDs and use them to spread hate speech and fake news, commit fraud and other crimes on these platforms.

A government notice directed the regulator, Nepal Telecommunications Authority, to deactivate unregistered social media but gave no details of which platforms faced action. The services will be restored once the platforms comply with its order, the government said.

Local media reported that the banned platforms include Meta's Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, Alphabet's YouTube, China's Tencent and Snapchat, Pinterest and X.

Many people in Nepal think corruption is rampant, and the government of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli has been criticised by opponents for failing to deliver on its promises to tackle graft or make progress in addressing longstanding economic issues.

Nepal's youngsters say the protest is an expression of their widespread frustration over the social media ban.
