# Nepal PM KP Oli resigns after violent anti-corruption protests sparked by social media ban

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned from his post, officials confirmed on Monday, bringing an abrupt end to his tenure.

Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Oli resigned on Monday, officials confirmed, stepping down amid mounting pressure after one of the deadliest crackdowns in years left at least 19 people dead and reignited nationwide protests.

His departure is expected to spark intense political negotiations as parties scramble to form a new government.

The resignation comes against the backdrop of angry demonstrations led largely by young Nepalis. Defying a curfew on Tuesday, protesters returned to the streets to vent frustration over corruption, unemployment, and a controversial ban on social media platforms that had cut access to Facebook, YouTube and X before being lifted.

At least 17 people were killed in clashes in Kathmandu on Monday, police said, with two more deaths reported in Sunsari district. Hundreds were injured, including more than 100 police. Amnesty International said live ammunition had been fired at demonstrators, while the United Nations has demanded a swift and transparent probe.

Despite government attempts at conciliation, including restoring access to social media and announcing all-party talks, anger has continued to boil over. Some protesters targeted government buildings and properties belonging to politicians, while others accused security forces of “murdering” civilians.

“Nearly 20 people were murdered by the state — that shows the scale of police brutality,” said 23-year-old student Yujan Rajbhandari, who joined Monday’s demonstrations.

With people aged 15 to 40 making up nearly 43 percent of Nepal’s population, analysts say the protests reflect a generational outcry against corruption, inequality and lack of opportunity. “This isn’t just about social media — it’s about trust, corruption, and a generation that refuses to stay silent,” the Kathmandu Post wrote in an editorial.

Oli, 73, had announced on Tuesday that he would personally head all-party talks to bring about a “meaningful conclusion” to the violence, but his decision to quit underlines the political volatility now gripping the Himalayan nation.

# Nepal protests Updates: Army to take charge of security after K.P. Sharma Oli resigns; President urges restraint

Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

In a significant escalation, Nepal’s Parliament building was set on fire by protestors as the Nepali Army and chiefs of other security agencies issued a joint appeal, urging restraint.

Eyewitnesses said that the public rage was not due to a ban on social media, but due to an alleged police firing on unarmed youth and children between the ages of 10 and 28 years as they protested peacefully on September 8 against corruption in the government and against the social media ban.

“This is a national movement now. It is not just the Gen Z, but even their parents and others who have taken to the streets. There is no limitation on the generation participating in the protest anymore. Why did they have to fire on innocent children and young people when they were protesting peacefully? That is what led to a trigger,” a health professional in Kathmandu said.

Nepal Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli on Tuesday (September 9, 2025) resigned amid continuing anti-corruption protests across the country.

Protests led by Nepal’s Gen Z continued for a second day on Tuesday (September 9, 2025), despite local administrations in three districts of the Kathmandu Valley imposing a curfew from the morning.
