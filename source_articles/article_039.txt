# Nepal Political Turmoil: Protests Escalate, PM KP Sharma Oli Reportedly Seeking Temporary Asylum In Dubai

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Kathmandu is reeling under fresh political turmoil as anti-corruption protests continue to sweep across Nepal, with violence erupting in multiple cities and several senior leaders facing public anger.

Amid the unrest, Nepalese media reports suggest Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is preparing to leave for Dubai, seeking medical treatment and possibly temporary asylum.

According to local outlets, Oli has placed Himalaya Airlines on standby for a possible flight to Dubai in the coming days. While his office maintains that the trip is for “medical treatment,” political observers say the move comes at a time of mounting pressure on the government.

Several ministers have resigned in protest against the handling of demonstrations, and key leaders’ residences have been targeted by angry crowds.

On Tuesday morning, demonstrators set fire to the private residence of Minister for Communication, Information and Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung in Sunakothi, Lalitpur. Protesters also occupied the home of former Prime Minister and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba.

The situation escalated as vehicles were torched inside Deuba’s premises, while protesters pelted stones at the residence of former Deputy Prime Minister Raghuveer Mahaseth in Janakpur.

In western Nepal, crowds broke through security and stormed the office of the Sudurpaschim Chief Minister, burning tires outside the gate.

The unrest has already triggered resignations at the highest levels of government. On Monday, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak stepped down, accepting moral responsibility for the deaths of at least 19 people during clashes with security forces.

On Tuesday, Agriculture Minister Ram Nath Adhikari also resigned, condemning what he called the government’s “authoritarian response” to the youth-led “Gen Z protests.”

The crisis has drawn international attention. India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it was “closely monitoring” developments in Nepal and expressed sorrow at the loss of young lives.

“We are deeply saddened by the loss of many young lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with families of the deceased. We hope all concerned exercise restraint and address issues through peaceful dialogue,” the MEA statement read.

The United Nations also voiced concern, with a spokesperson for the Secretary-General emphasizing the need to protect civil rights.

“It’s critical that the authorities respect the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. Security forces must comply with the basic principles on the use of force,” the UN said.

In anticipation of his departure, Oli has reportedly delegated key responsibilities to his Deputy Prime Minister, further fueling speculation that he may not return soon.

With protests spreading and security forces struggling to contain unrest, opposition leaders have accused the government of losing legitimacy.

As the Gen Z protests in Nepal entered Day 2 on Tuesday, students leading the agitation are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli.

Sources said that Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is planning to seek asylum in Dubai.

Nepal's political crisis deepened on Tuesday as Army Chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel asked Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to resign amid violent Gen Z-led protests sweeping the country, sources told _India Today TV_.

According to officials familiar with the conversation, Oli spoke to the Army Chief, urging him to take charge of the worsening situation. General Sigdel responded that the Army could only stabilise the country if Oli relinquished power. Army sources also said the military is prepared to step in once Oli steps down.

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister also requested the Army's assistance in securing a safe passage out of his official residence in Baluwatar and has sought help to leave the country. Sources said Oli is planning to fly to Dubai under the pretext of medical treatment, with private carrier Himalaya Airlines kept on standby.

Meanwhile, ministers of the Oli-led government are being airlifted to the airport from their residences in army helicopters. At least five helicopters have been deployed to evacuate Cabinet ministers, even as curfews remain in force across Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur.

Around a dozen army helicopters were deployed from helipads at the Bhaisepati ministerial quarters, south of Kathmandu, to Kathmandu International Airport, ferrying ministers to safety. The airport has become a flashpoint. Protesters are using social media to urge supporters to disrupt operations by firing fireworks, flying drones, and shining laser beams at aircraft.

The Prime Minister has also called an all-party meeting at 6 pm today to assess the situation and find a meaningful conclusion.

"I am in dialogue with the relevant parties to assess the situation and find a meaningful conclusion. For that, I have also called an all-party meeting at 6 pm today. I humbly request all brothers and sisters to remain calm in this difficult situation," Oli said in a letter.

On Tuesday, Health Minister Pradeep Paudel became the third minister to resign in protest against the violent crackdown on demonstrators. Paudel's exit followed two earlier resignations triggered by Monday's clashes, which left at least 20 people dead and over 300 injured.

Earlier, Nepal Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak and Agriculture Minister Ramnath Adhikari resigned on moral grounds following the deadly clashes.

The unrest has spread to top political leaders' residences. Protesters stormed and set ablaze the private homes of President Ramchandra Paudel and Prime Minister Oli. Earlier, demonstrators vandalised the residence of former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ in Lalitpur and torched several vehicles inside the compound of Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba.

Eyewitnesses said Deuba’s residence was overrun before cars were set on fire. Moreover, Nepali Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel was brutally assaulted by protesters.

The government had late on Monday rolled back its sweeping ban on 26 social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and X, following an emergency Cabinet meeting. The move came after widespread anger over the blackout triggered violent demonstrations, killing at least 20 people and injuring over 300.

Fresh protests broke out on Tuesday, with students leading marches demanding Oli’s resignation. Demonstrators shouted slogans such as _"KP Chor, Desh Chhod"_ (Oli is a thief, quit the country) and accused the leadership of shielding corrupt politicians. Crowds also threw stones at the residence of Communication Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung in Lalitpur, who initially announced the ban.

Authorities have imposed curfews in Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur districts as the unrest shows no sign of abating. The Nepali Army was deployed in Kathmandu on Monday after tensions spiralled, with troops taking control of the roads around the Parliament complex in New Baneshwor.
