# Ayo Edebiri, Olivia Colman, Mark Ruffalo, others back film industry boycott of Israeli institutions over Gaza conflict

A group of well-known actors and filmmakers—including Olivia Colman, Ayo Edebiri, Mark Ruffalo, and director Yorgos Lanthimos—have joined over 1,300 film industry professionals in signing a pledge to boycott Israeli film institutions.

The pledge, organised by Film Workers for Palestine, calls on industry figures to refuse work with Israeli film bodies and companies that are, in their words, “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.”

“As filmmakers, actors, film industry workers and institutions, we recognize the power of cinema to shape perceptions,” reads the pledge. “In this urgent moment of crisis, where many of our governments are enabling the carnage in Gaza, we must do everything we can to address complicity in that unrelenting horror.”

The statement goes on to cite a recent ruling by the International Court of Justice, which found a “plausible risk of genocide in Gaza”, and states that “Israel’s occupation and apartheid against Palestinians are unlawful.”

The pledge draws inspiration from Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, a movement from the 1980s which included names like Martin Scorsese and Jonathan Demme. That group pushed for a film industry boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era.

Oscar-nominated producer Mike Lerner supported the new pledge, calling it a peaceful and necessary action:

“It is the responsibility of every independently minded artist to use whatever powers of expression they possess to support the global resistance to overcome this horror,” he said. “This pledge is an essential non-violent tool to undermine the deadly impunity that Israel and its allies currently enjoy.”

The pledge reflects growing activism within the arts community, with actors, directors, and producers increasingly using their platforms to speak out on political and humanitarian issues.

# Ayo Edebiri, Olivia Colman, Mark Ruffalo and Yorgos Lanthimos Back Boycott of Israeli Film Institutions

A host of Hollywood insiders are backing a new pledge to boycott working with Israeli film institutions and companies that are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.”

Film Workers for Palestine announced the pledge this morning, citing the signatures of more than 1,300 filmmakers, actors, creatives and other industry professionals including Olivia Colman, Ayo Edebiri, Mark Ruffalo, Riz Ahmed, Tilda Swinton, Javier Bardem, Yorgos Lanthimos, Josh O’Connor, Emma Stone, Ava DuVernay, Asif Kapadia, Emma Seligman, Boots Riley, Hannah Einbinder, Cynthia Nixon, Adam McKay, Joshua Oppenheimer and others.

“As filmmakers, actors, film industry workers and institutions, we recognize the power of cinema to shape perceptions,” reads the pledge. “In this urgent moment of crisis, where many of our governments are enabling the carnage in Gaza, we must do everything we can to address complicity in that unrelenting horror. The world’s highest court, the International Court of Justice, has ruled that there is a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza, and that Israel’s occupation and apartheid against Palestinians are unlawful. Standing for equality, justice and freedom for all is a profound moral duty that none of us can ignore.”

Per Film Workers for Palestine, the pledge was inspired by Filmmakers United Against Apartheid, which was founded by high-profile directors like Jonathan Demme and Martin Scorsese to demand that the film industry refuse to distribute work in South Africa.

“It is the responsibility of every independently minded artist to use whatever powers of expression they possess to support the global resistance to overcome this horror,” said Oscar nominated producer Mike Lerner in a statement. “This pledge is an essential non-violent tool to undermine the deadly impunity that Israel and its allies currently enjoy.”

In a statement to the _Guardian_, the Israeli Producers Association responded to the boycott pledge. “The signatories of this petition are targeting the wrong people. For decades, we Israeli artists, storytellers, and creators have been the primary voices allowing audiences to hear and witness the complexity of the conflict, including Palestinian narratives and criticism of Israeli state policies. We work with Palestinian creators, telling our shared stories and promoting peace and an end to violence through thousands of films, TV series, and documentaries.

The statement continued, “This call for a boycott is profoundly misguided. By targeting us – the creators who give voice to diverse narratives and foster dialogue – these signatories are undermining their own cause and attempting to silence us. This shortsighted act seeks to eliminate precisely the collaborative efforts working toward ending violence and achieving peace. We will not allow this and will push back in our efforts to end violence and bring just peace to our region for the benefit of all.”

# Actors, entertainers pledge to boycott Israeli film institutions over Gaza

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Over 1,800 actors, entertainers, and producers, including some Hollywood stars, signed a pledge released on Monday to not work with Israeli film institutions that they see as being complicit in the abuse of Palestinians by Israel.

Some companies have faced calls for boycotts and protests over ties with the Israeli government as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza from Israel’s military assault grows, and images of starving Palestinians, including children, have sparked global outrage.

“Inspired by Filmmakers United Against Apartheid who refused to screen their films in apartheid South Africa, we pledge not to screen films, appear at or otherwise work with Israeli film institutions – including festivals, cinemas, broadcasters and production companies – that are implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people,” the pledge read.

The pledge said it was not urging anyone to stop working with Israeli individuals but instead “the call is for film workers to refuse to work with Israeli institutions that are complicit in Israel’s human rights abuses.”

Israeli film institutions had engaged in “whitewashing or justifying” abuse of Palestinians, it said.

It noted last year’s International Court of Justice opinion that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories is illegal and assessments by multiple rights experts and scholars that Israel’s military assault on Gaza amounts to genocide.

Signatories included actors Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Tilda Swinton, Riz Ahmed, Javier Bardem, and Cynthia Nixon, among others.

Israel’s government has previously dismissed boycott calls against Israeli institutions as discriminatory. Israel says its actions in Gaza amount to “self-defense” after the October 2023 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants in which 1,200 people were killed and over 250 taken hostage, Israeli tallies show.

U.S. ally Israel’s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed tens of thousands of people, internally displaced Gaza’s entire population, and set off a starvation crisis.

Last week, The Voice of Hind Rajab, a film about a five-year-old Palestinian girl killed by Israeli forces in Gaza last year, got a standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival. Brad Pitt and Joaquin Phoenix were among the film’s executive producers.
