# Apple unveils Apple Watch Series 11, Watch Ultra 3, and Watch SE 3

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Apple on Tuesday unveiled three new Apple Watch configurations at its annual hardware event: the Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch Ultra 3, and Apple Watch SE 3.

## Apple Watch Series 11

The Apple Watch Series 11 can alert you to possible hypertension. It uses data from the optical heart sensor and looks for chronic high blood pressure by analyzing how your blood vessels respond to the heart’s beats. The algorithm works in the background, reviewing data over 30-day periods and will notify you if it identifies patterns of hypertension.

Apple says it plans to notify over 1 million people with undiagnosed hypertension in the first year alone. In addition to the Series 11, hypertension alerts will also be available on the Series 9 and 10.

The Apple Watch Series 11 can also help you understand the quality of your sleep and how to make it more restorative. The new Sleep Score feature factors in such things as sleep duration, bed time, consistency, how often you wake up, and the time spent in each sleep stage.

It also debuts with 5G connectivity, bringing an improvement over the existing LTE connectivity options. It uses less battery and provides even more coverage.

Apple Watch Series 11 now gets up to 24 hours of battery life and comes in Jet Black, Silver, Rose Gold, and a new Space Gray. It starts at $399.

## Apple Watch Ultra 3

The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is launching with a larger screen and satellite connectivity. As with the Series 11, it’s also getting 5G connectivity and hypertension notifications.

The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is the first Apple Watch with satellite connectivity, allowing you to tap into Apple’s satellite feature for emergency communications in remote areas. You can also send messages and share your location with Find My to enable satellite connectivity.

Satellite connectivity can be used when a cellular signal or Wi-Fi is not available; it lets people do things like contact emergency services and send a text by satellite.

The watch comes with up to 42 hours of battery life, with up to 72 hours in low power mode.

It comes with LTPO3 and wide-angle OLEDs, making it the largest screen of any Apple Watch ever, and brighter when viewed from an angle. TPO3 is a high-performance, low-power display technology that enables the display borders to be 24% thinner, Apple notes.

Apple Watch Ultra 3 is available in Black and Natural Titanium. Prices start at $799.

## Apple Watch SE 3

The Apple Watch SE 3 is launching with a newer display and a faster chip, the S10, which allows for a huge improvement over the S8 chip used in the Apple Watch SE 2.

The chip upgrade allows for always-on display for the first time. It also supports gestures like double-tap and wrist flick.

The S10 chip also enables SE 3 to get all-day 18-hour battery life, and for the first time, the SE supports fast charging. The SE 3 comes with wrist temperature sensing, which enables retrospective ovulation estimates and gives you richer insights in the vitals app.

Apple Watch SE starts at $249. It is available in 40 mm and 44 mm sizes and comes in Midnight and Starlight aluminum cases.
