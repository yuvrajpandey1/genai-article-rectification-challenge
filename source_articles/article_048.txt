More about Janaawar – The Beast Within

ZEE5 announces the premiere of its latest original series, Janaawar – The Beast Within, starring Bhuvan Arora in a breakthrough lead role. It is a layered crime drama that promises to take viewers into the rhythm of a rural town, where ancient hierarchies clash with modern crime and corruption.

The plot follows the story of Sub-Inspector Hemant Kumar, played by Bhuvan Arora—a sharp, relentless officer from a marginalized tribal caste whose life is upended by a series of chilling events in the town. A headless corpse, lost gold, and a missing man create a chain of mysteries that pulls him into a dangerous investigation.

As Hemant delves deeper into the investigation, he not only confronts the darkness of human greed but also the burden of systemic bias, his own inner demons, and personal struggles that threaten to break him.

Janaawar – The Beast Within is more than a crime thriller and focuses on the story of a man’s fight for dignity in a world determined to deny him recognition, and of a community’s deep-rooted faith in its Gram Devta. As Hemant uncovers layers of guilt, betrayal, and hidden truths, he learns that true identity is not forged by birth, but by courage in the face of adversity.
