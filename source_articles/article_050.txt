Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

Lexus India has announced a reduction in prices across its entire vehicle lineup, fully passing on the benefits of the recent GST rate revision to customers. The revised pricing will take effect from 22nd September 2025, aligning with the festive season to enhance accessibility to luxury mobility.

Hikaru Ikeuchi, President of Lexus India, stated, “We sincerely thank the Government of India for this historic reform and are delighted to extend the full benefit of the GST rate reduction to our valued customers. This initiative not only improves accessibility but also instills greater confidence in the luxury mobility space. At Lexus, our philosophy of Omotenashi guides every decision, ensuring meaningful and personalized experiences for our customers. By extending these benefits in full, we reaffirm our commitment to making Lexus ownership memorable.”

The potential price reductions for Lexus vehicles in India are as follows:**Model**| **Price Reduction**  
---|---  
ES 300h| Up to Rs 1,47,000  
NX 350h| Up to Rs 1,58,000  
RX 350h| Up to Rs 2,10,000  
RX 500h| Up to Rs 2,58,000  
LM 350h| Up to Rs 5,77,000  
LX 500d| Up to Rs 20,80,000  

The announcement follows the 56th GST Council meeting held on 3rd September 2025, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, where the government introduced GST 2.0, a landmark reform designed to enhance affordability and simplify tax rates in the automotive sector.

Under the new framework, GST on small cars, motorcycles up to 350cc, three-wheelers, buses, trucks, and ambulances has been reduced from 28% to 18%. Small cars—defined as vehicles under four metres in length with engines up to 1,200cc (petrol) or 1,500cc (diesel)—will now attract 18% GST without any additional cess.

In contrast, larger vehicles with engines exceeding 1.2 litres (petrol) or 1.5 litres (diesel), as well as motorcycles above 350cc, will now be taxed at 40% GST.

For the agricultural sector, GST on tractors, harvesters, threshers, fodder balers, and other farm machinery has been lowered from 12% to 5%. Additionally, all auto components will now carry a uniform GST of 18%, streamlining the overall tax structure.
