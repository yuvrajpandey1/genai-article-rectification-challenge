# Prince Harry Visits Queen Elizabeth’s Burial Site on Anniversary of Her Death After Returning to U.K.

Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

The Duke of Sussex visited St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, where the Queen was laid to rest in September 2022.

Prince Harry is paying his own special tribute to his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth.

The Duke of Sussex, 40, visited the burial place of the late Queen at St. George's Chapel in Windsor to pay his respects privately and lay a wreath of flowers, three years after the history-making monarch died, a spokesperson for the prince confirmed to PEOPLE.

Upon his arrival in the U.K. on Monday, a source tells PEOPLE that the prince is in a “positive” mood.

“He's in a really good headspace and looking forward to seeing everyone from his charities and the causes he cares about,” the source continues.

Queen Elizabeth died at Balmoral Castle in Scotland on Sept. 8, 2022, at age 96. She was laid to rest beside her husband of 73 years, Prince Philip, during a private burial service at the King George VI Memorial Chapel within the Windsor Castle grounds on Sept. 19 following her state funeral and committal service.

On that solemn day three years ago, Queen Elizabeth joined her parents, King George VI, who died in 1952, and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who died in 2002, as well as her sister, Princess Margaret, who also died in 2002, who are all interred in the tiny chapel within St. George's.

St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle is a special place for Harry as his wedding to Meghan Markle, 44, took place there in May 2018. Harry also visited his grandmother's resting place in 2023.

Prince Harry and Meghan, who have resided in California since shortly after stepping back from their royal roles in 2020, were scheduled to attend the WellChild Awards in the U.K. in 2022 when doctors announced their "concerns" for Queen Elizabeth's health. Harry traveled to Scotland upon learning the news, and the couple extended their stay in the U.K. to attend her funeral events.

Prince Harry arrived in the U.K. early on Sept. 8 ahead of a series of visits with his charities this week. He is traveling without Meghan or their two children, Prince Archie, 6, and Princess Lilibet, 4.

His first engagement is at the annual awards for WellChild. The charity, which Harry has been a patron of since 2007, is holding its celebration evening honoring young people who live with challenging and life-limiting conditions and marking the contributions of those who look after them, from parents to nursing staff and carers.

Prince Harry will make a speech and hand out one of the prizes.

The Duke of Sussex is expected to be in the U.K. for a few days, leading to speculation that he might also use the time to meet with his father, King Charles, for the first time in more than 18 months.

Due to their estrangement, made worse by a legal battle Harry was fighting over the removal of his official security in the U.K., Prince Harry has not seen his father in person since February 2024, soon after the King revealed he was being treated for an undisclosed cancer. When Harry returned to the U.K. in May 2024 to mark the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games and that September for last year's WellChild Awards, he and his father also did not meet up.

Prince Harry returned to London in April this year to attend court amid the appeal to restore his security, a battle which he ultimately ended up losing. Relations are strained too with his brother Prince William and sister-in-law Kate Middleton.

But Prince Harry has made no secret of his desire for a reunion with his family, telling BBC News in May that he "would love reconciliation with my family. There's no point in continuing to fight anymore." Hopes were raised for a rapprochement between Harry and his father in July when aides of Harry and the King met for the first time in London.

# Harry talks of sibling 'challenge', after paying respects to late Queen at Windsor

Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

The Duke of Sussex has not been in the UK since May, and it is not known if he will meet his brother Prince William, or his father, the King, during his visit.

Prince Harry has visited Windsor Castle to lay a wreath and pay respects to the late Queen, before talking about the challenges of sibling relationships.

The Duke of Sussex arrived in the UK on Monday and visited the royal residence, where he left flowers for the former monarch on the third anniversary of the late Queen's death.

Harry then attended the annual WellChild Awards in London, amid speculation his trip could include meetings with his brother, Prince William, or his father, the King.

The WellChild Awards marked the first time the Duke of Sussex, who is the charity's patron, has returned to the UK in five months.

Harry was pictured speaking with seriously ill youngsters ahead of a glittering awards ceremony, which aims to recognise their efforts to succeed and thrive despite life-threatening conditions.

He appeared to allude to his strained relationship with William while chatting with Declan Bitmead, 17, when Harry learned the teenager had a younger brother.

"Does he drive you mad?" Harry asked, and Declan replied: "No, we get on fine".

But when Harry, who followed William to Eton, learned that Declan and his brother went to the same school, he said: "That sometimes makes it more challenging.''

Grace Tutt, 13, who is wheelchair-bound after a bus crash, asked the duke for Netflix recommendations.

The Prince said he and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, who live in California after stepping down as working royals, watch the political thriller Hostage together, and he also enjoys the reality TV show Love Is Blind.

Harry also enjoyed a balloon sword fight with nine-year-old Gwen Foster, who was born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus, and challenged him to a duel with the toys made by a balloon sculptor.

Earlier on Monday, the Princess of Wales joined her husband to pay respects to Queen Elizabeth II during a visit to the National Federation of Women's Institutes in Sunningdale, Berkshire.

It marks Kate's third engagement in five days, after she visited the National History Museum's gardens last Thursday before watching England's women's rugby side, the Red Roses, beat Australia 47-7 in their Women's Rugby World Cup match in Brighton on Saturday.

It's been a while since we've seen pictures of both Prince Harry and Prince William out on engagements on the same day in the UK. Geographically, they were closer than they've been in some time, but sadly it seems emotionally still so far apart.

Prince Harry has flown in for what him and his team want to be a trip with no negativity. The WellChild awards is always an event where he shines.

The children don't seem to care who he is or what they ask him. An openness that's also been clear from Harry's team, with much less secrecy than previous trips.

The one thing they have been careful to avoid talking about is his relatives, especially as his arrival came on a poignant day for the family. Gun salutes in London marking three years since Queen Elizabeth died, as the King spent his accession day privately in Scotland.

Whether his father will travel to London in time to see Harry this week, the palace won't say.

We were told that Harry did go to Windsor to lay flowers as a tribute to his grandmother, taking him even closer to Prince William who lives on the Windsor estate. But there was no suggestion of a meet-up, as around the same time William was about eight miles away in Sunningdale with the Princess of Wales, sharing stories and tea with members of the Women's Institute who had met his grandmother.

One thing the two brothers would no doubt be united on, whether they're talking or not, is their desire that we'd all stop fixating on them and focus on the engagements they were doing instead.

As a crowd gathered outside the Royal Lancaster Hotel to get a glimpse of Harry, it had been a day which felt like a reminder of how families do go through painful times.

With talk of reconciliation and a potential reset, we wait to see if the Windsors are really any closer to moving on.

Harry has had little contact with his father and elder brother since he and his wife gave up royal duties and moved to California in 2020.

Harry and Charles last met face-to-face more than a year and a half ago after the duke rushed over from his home in the US to see the King following his cancer diagnosis.

The relationship became even frostier after the couple bared their grievances with Buckingham Palace in a tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey, a Netflix series and Harry's memoir, Spare.

Harry was last in London in April when the Court of Appeal rejected his bid to restore police protection that was cancelled after he stopped being a working royal.

# Harry praises children's resilience as he returns to UK

Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

Prince Harry has been meeting children with serious health problems at the WellChild charity awards in London - as the prince returns to the UK for a week of engagements.

The prince arrived from the US on Monday morning - and went to Windsor to lay a wreath at the chapel where the late Queen Elizabeth II is buried, on the third anniversary of her death.

At the awards Prince Harry chatted with children, including a play swordfight with balloons. In one conversation he revealed he had been enjoying the Netflix series Hostage.

He also joked about sibling rivalry, asking one award winner about his brother: "Does he drive you mad?"... "You know what - siblings".

In a speech marking the 20th year of the awards, Harry commended the children at the event: "Your courage, your resilience, and the extraordinary love of the families and carers who never stop showing up."

"The world has thrown a fair few challenges our way," said Prince Harry, but he said the annual awards, recognising the achievements of children with complex medical needs, had remained an inspirational highlight each year.

Among the winners was Esmée McGlinchey from Stoke-on-Trent, aged six, who has undergone 35 rounds of surgery and faces daily medical challenges.

There has been speculation about whether Prince Harry will meet his father during his UK visit, with the two not having met face to face since February 2024, soon after King Charles had been diagnosed with cancer.

Prince Harry's wife Meghan and their children have remained at their home in California.

On Tuesday, Prince Harry will be in Nottingham where he will announce a significant donation to a Children in Need project and on Wednesday he will be at Imperial College London, to visit the Centre for Blast Injury Studies.

The start of Prince Harry's visit has been on the day on which the legacy of Queen Elizabeth II has been remembered, three years after Britain's longest reigning monarch died at the age of 96.

The Prince and Princess of Wales visited a Women's Institute event in Sunningdale, Berkshire, to meet members of an organisation with a long association with the late Queen.

Over tea and homemade cake, Prince William and Catherine heard about the sense of community and support created by the Women's Institute, which the late Queen had belonged to for 80 years.

"Three years ago my grandmother passed away, I know she was a big part of the WI and she used to talk about it a lot, so this is a huge honour for me," said Prince William.

"I can't quite believe it's three years already," he said.

Guests were reminiscing about the late Queen's interest in racing and he said that she used to follow news about her horses on an iPad.

"I think she would have liked a few more winners," said Prince William about her love of horse racing.

The prince chatted to guests about the value of meeting people in person rather than using social media. "It's not the same as face to face with a cup of tea and a cake and having a chat," he said.

The royal visitors also faced questions about their own children, saying they were at an age when they could "wind up" each other.

Prince William was wearing a dark jacket and tie, at a time of royal mourning for the Duchess of Kent, who died last Thursday.
