# Karisma Kapoor's Children Seek Share In Sunjay Kapur's Rs 30,000-Crore Estate

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Karisma Kapoor's children have sought partition of the estate.

In a fresh development in the high-stakes battle over late industrialist Sunjay Kapur's approximately Rs 30,000 crore estate, his two children from his marriage with Bollywood actor Karisma Kapoor have approached the Delhi High Court seeking their rightful share.

The siblings have filed a civil suit alleging that their stepmother, Priya Kapur (the third wife of Sunjay Kapur), has attempted to forge their father's will to gain complete control over his assets.

The children, represented through their mother as legal guardian, have sought partition of the estate, rendition of accounts, and a permanent injunction against the defendants.

According to the plaint, the children contend that they do not have complete information about their father's assets at the time of his death. They have attached a schedule of known properties but accused Defendant No. 1 (Priya Kapur) of concealing details and failing to disclose the full extent of assets.

The plaintiffs argue that until their father's sudden demise on June 12, 2025 while playing polo in Windsor, UK, they shared a close relationship with him, including frequent travels, holidays, and regular involvement in his business and personal milestones.

The plaintiffs in the case have accused Priya Kapur of initially denying the existence of any will and asserting that all of Sunjay Kapur's assets were held under the R.K. Family Trust.

However, they claim she later presented a document dated March 21, 2025, which she described as a will, prompting suspicions of forgery and manipulation.

The legal dispute involves several parties. The plaintiffs are the daughter and minor son of Karisma Kapoor and Sunjay Kapur, represented in court through their mother.

The first and second defendants are Priya Kapur, Sunjay's widow, and her minor son, both of whom reside at the family's farmhouse in Rajokri. The third defendant is Sunjay Kapur's mother, also living at the same residence. The fourth defendant is a woman who has identified herself as the executor of the contested will.

According to the children, their late father had repeatedly assured them of their financial security and future well-being. They claim he had initiated business ventures in their names, acquired assets both personally and through corporate entities, and named them as beneficiaries of the family trust.

These assurances, they argue, were reinforced through shared vacations, business conversations, and personal interactions that reflected his commitment to their future.

Following Sunjay Kapur's death, the children performed his final rites, with the son lighting the funeral pyre at Lodhi Cremation Ground on June 19. Tensions escalated soon after, as Priya Kapur allegedly began limiting their access to trust-related documents and financial assets.

The plaintiffs further allege that they were summoned to corporate meetings of Sona BLW Precision Forgings Ltd. (Sona Comstar) and asked to sign legal paperwork without being provided full transparency regarding the trust deed or associated records.

The legal battle over the estate of the late Sunjay Kapur has taken a new turn as Karisma Kapoor’s children have approached the Delhi High Court seeking their share in their father’s wealth.

The suit raises serious questions over the conduct of Priya Sachdeva, who now controls key aspects of the estate.

Sunjay Kapur’s children, identified as the legal heirs, have filed a suit in Delhi High Court seeking partition of the estate, rendition of accounts, and a permanent injunction. The suit claims that after the death of their father, Priya Sachdeva refused to share any documents or information regarding his assets and took steps to dispose of them to the detriment of the children.

The suit explicitly seeks a direction for Priya Sachdeva to disclose on oath the status of Sunjay Kapur’s estate as of the date of his death, along with any actions taken thereafter.

### THE WILL CONTROVERSY

A key allegation in the suit is the mysterious emergence of a so-called last will of Sunjay Kapur dated 21 March 2025. The children state they were repeatedly told by Priya Sachdeva that no will existed.

Only after more than seven weeks following their father’s death did a meeting take place where the will executor briefly displayed a document but did not provide a copy or share it in full.

The suit argues that this sudden appearance of the will under suspicious circumstances raises serious doubts. It points out that two individuals closely connected to Priya Sachdeva were responsible for presenting the document, which deepens the suspicion.

### LACK OF TRANSPARENCY

At the time of their father’s death, the children claim they were informed that the RK Family Trust held all of Sunjay Kapur’s assets. Despite being told that forms related to the Trust would need to be signed during an Annual General Meeting (AGM) scheduled for July 25, 2025, they later received a call saying their attendance was no longer required, without explanation.

The children and their mother were never provided with the family trust deed or full details about the trust’s assets. This lack of transparency is a central issue in the suit.

### SUSPICION OVER CONDUCT OF PRIYA SACHDEVA

The suit states that Priya Sachdeva’s conduct is highly questionable. The fact that the alleged will appeared so long after multiple assurances that no such will existed suggests that the document may have been manufactured or surfaced under dubious conditions.

The plaintiffs argue that it is “unnatural and not normal conduct” for the will to have been kept hidden for weeks and only revealed in such a manner, creating a sequence of events filled with contradictions.

The children are demanding a fair share in the personal assets and effects of their late father. They assert that as legal heirs, they are entitled to transparency and an equitable partition of the estate.

The court will now have to examine the legitimacy of the so-called will, the status of the family trust, and whether Priya Sachdeva’s actions harmed the rightful claim of the children.
