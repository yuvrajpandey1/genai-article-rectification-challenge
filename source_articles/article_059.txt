Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

HCL Technologies on September 8 announced that the company has appointed former G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant as an Independent Director for a term of five years.

Amitabh Kant's five-year term will expire on September 7, 2030. His appointment has been recommended by the firm's Nomination & Remuneration Committee.

Kant, a former IAS officer of the 1980 Kerala cadre batch, is known for his role in several key national initiatives, including 'Make in India', 'Startup India', and the 'Incredible India' tourism campaign. He most recently served as India’s G20 Sherpa during the country’s presidency of the grouping.

During his G20 tenure, Kant played a lead role in achieving consensus on the New Delhi Leaders' Declaration. The agreement focused on global economic challenges, climate finance, digital public infrastructure, and reforms in key sectors like technology and geopolitics.

"Amitabh Kant is a governance reformer and a public policy change agent and was most recently India’s G20 Sherpa. His leadership as Sherpa during India's G20 Presidency (2022-2023) culminated in the unanimous adoption of the historic New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration, which galvanized global consensus around pressing issues, including driving global growth, promulgating India’s model of digital public infrastructure, and advocating ambitious reforms in climate finance, geopolitics, and technology," HCL Tech said in its press release.

He also served as the CEO of NITI Aayog for six years, where he oversaw flagship programs like the Aspirational Districts Programme—praised by the UNDP for improving development indicators in underperforming regions. His past roles include stints with the National Highways Authority of India and India’s National Statistical Commission.

"In his 6+ years as the CEO, Mr. Kant has driven transformative policies and initiatives that have reshaped India's development trajectory—a highlight of which is the Aspirational Districts Program, a groundbreaking effort to uplift India's most underdeveloped districts through strategic competition, focused governance, and targeted interventions," HCLTech said.

HCLTech Chairperson Roshni Nadar Malhotra said, "We are delighted to have Amitabh Kant join the Board. His rich experience in building public sector institutions and contribution to India’s reforms will offer immense insights towards shaping HCLTech's growth strategy."

The company's CEO & Managing Director C Vijayakumar meanwhile said, "Amitabh Kant joins us at a pivotal moment in our journey as well as within the industry. His thought leadership and long-term thinking will be invaluable in shaping our strategy. Amitabh shares our values and our ambition, and I look forward to his counsel as we execute our strategic plans."

HCLTech shares dropped more than 1 percent to close at Rs 1,403.30 apiece. The stock has fallen over 4 percent in the past five days, and around 5 percent in the past one month. It has dropped nearly 27 percent in 2025 so far.

A policymaker with global recognition

Most recently, he served as India’s G20 Sherpa (2022–2023), where he was instrumental in steering negotiations that culminated in the adoption of the New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration. The declaration, which achieved consensus among global leaders, laid out cooperative frameworks on economic growth, digital public infrastructure, climate finance reforms, and technology partnerships.

During India’s G20 presidency, Kant emerged as a key voice for advancing the Global South’s priorities while positioning India as a consensus builder on pressing international issues.

Legacy at NITI Aayog and beyond

Before his G20 role, Kant served as the CEO of NITI Aayog, where he oversaw some of India’s most significant policy programmes. These included the Aspirational Districts Programme, which sought to uplift underdeveloped regions; Startup India, aimed at fostering entrepreneurship; and extensive Ease of Doing Business reforms to improve India’s global competitiveness.

Kant also championed Make in India and the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, designed to boost domestic manufacturing and exports. Earlier in his career, he spearheaded tourism campaigns such as Incredible India and God’s Own Country, both of which received global acclaim.

With his appointment, HCLTech signals its intent to deepen its engagement with public policy, innovation, and global governance at a time when India’s IT services sector is increasingly shaping conversations around technology, digital infrastructure, and sustainability.
