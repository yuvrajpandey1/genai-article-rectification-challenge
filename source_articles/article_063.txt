Volvo Car India, on Tuesday, announced that it has reduced prices across its internal combustion engine (ICE) portfolio by up to ₹6.9 lakh, effective September 22, 2025. The change follows the recent Goods and Services Tax (GST) rationalisation approved by the GST Council.

The new tax structure, which replaces multiple higher tax slabs with a simpler system, has enabled the company to pass on direct benefits to customers. Prices of Volvo’s battery electric vehicles (BEVs) remain unchanged, though they are covered under special festive offers.

**Model**| **Before GST (₹)**| **After GST (₹)**|  **Price Decrease (₹)**  
---|---|---|---  
**Volvo XC60 (MY26 Refreshed)**|  ₹71,90,000| ₹67,10,667| ₹4,79,333  
**Volvo XC90 (MY26)**|  ₹1,03,89,000| ₹96,97,240| ₹6,92,660  

Alongside the revised prices, the company has introduced festive schemes under what it calls a 'Double Festive Delight,' combining GST benefits with additional offers.

Jyoti Malhotra, Managing Director of Volvo Car India, in a company statement, said that the initiative is aimed at making luxury mobility more accessible while reinforcing confidence in the growth of this segment in India.

“We are poised for a strong and successful festive season, driven by this positive change and our robust product portfolio,” he added.
