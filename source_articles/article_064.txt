# Muhammad Waseem: 'We can absolutely inflict an upset on India or Pakistan'

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

There are few sides in T20 cricket whose captain is quite as central as Muhammad Waseem is to UAE. Since making his international debut in 2021, Waseem has amassed nearly three times as many runs as the next best UAE batter, and boasts a strike rate nearly 20 points clear of anyone else. Three of the four T20I hundreds UAE have scored in T20Is have come off his bat, and he has established himself as a formidable opener in the format.

Ahead of the men's T20 Asia Cup, ESPNcricinfo caught up with him to talk about his move to the Emirates, his goals at the tournament, and why the ILT20 has made such a difference to the nation's cricketing fortunes.

**What are your big picture goals for UAE in the foreseeable future?**  
My goal as captain is to make UAE a Full Member. The more we play against Test nations and beat them, that will help all our numbers as well as the team ranking. I believe we have a shot at this and I want to make this happen while I'm still around. We've got Afghanistan's example to follow. I want the same for us, and that's my goal.

**At 31 and in your current form, do you believe you're in the prime of your career?**  
You could say that. I've been performing for my team for the past three years. If I hang around the team for the next five to seven years, then I hope to achieve the goals I mentioned earlier while I'm with the team.

**How did the captaincy come to you?**  
I did very well in domestic cricket here, such that I was offered a national contract before I had even made my debut for UAE. My career started well; I scored a hundred in my first series in a T20I. I continued to perform well, and that was a time the UAE side was in transition. We didn't have many senior players and the team was quite new.

Perhaps the selectors thought I had what it took to be captain, because I was also captain for my domestic side for the previous four to five years. In that time, my team won the D10 and D20 tournaments [ECB domestic tournaments] a number of times. Maybe that record of mine made them think I could do this, and they decided to give me the captaincy.

**You've opened in all but one match in your T20I career, but you attack a lot more in the powerplay than your team-mate at the other end. Is that strategic or just your natural game?**  
It is a bit of a strategic move for me to attack in the powerplay. For example, when Muhammad Zohaib opens with me, I take the bowler on while the other opener tries to preserve their wicket. In modern cricket, when one of the top four plays most of the innings, the team tends to score 170 or more. When I attack, Zohaib is more circumspect and waits for loose deliveries to put away.

**UAE got themselves into some really good positions in the tri-nation series, but couldn't see them through to the finish. Why was that?**  
It comes down to lack of experience. If we had experience, then in the two games against Afghanistan, and if I hadn't lost my wicket and Asif [Khan] hadn't fallen the next over in the first game against them, the story might have been different. Even if we needed 50-55 in the last five overs, we could have chased it down.

> "We see each other all the time, and the boys get along very well. So it isn't much of an issue managing this group. I know now how to use our bowlers, because I know this team so well given the time I've spent with them and captained them"

**The side relies quite heavily on two or three power-hitters. Do you need more firepower with the bat?**  
The combination we have now is the best combination. Alishan Sharafu, Asif Khan and myself are among the bigger hitters. We've spaced our team's batting order such that one person who's at the crease attacks while the other holds up an end or rotates the strike. So I open, Alishan is in the middle and Asif lower down the order. The idea is that we've always got someone who can charge a bowler.

**What would success look like at the Asia Cup for the UAE?**  
We've been working very hard for the past two to three months and can beat anyone in this format. It comes down to what kind of cricket we play on the day, and whether we apply ourselves the way we've planned it. We can absolutely inflict an upset on one of India or Pakistan. We could beat Oman and we'll target one of these two and eye a run to the Super Four.

**UAE won a series against Bangladesh but then finished second to Uganda in a multi-team tournament in Entebbe. How large is the gap between the more established sides and yourselves?**  
The skill level exists in our team too, but we lack experience and the ability to execute our plans consistently. When it all clicks, we can give anyone a tough time. In Uganda, I have to be honest, we couldn't perform to the best of our abilities. We appeared a bit too casual there, and I would like us to forget about that one and not repeat our mistakes from then.

> "Five years ago, only your mates and your parents came to watch you here. Now, we see crowds coming to watch and support us. In the matches coming up, we can expect some support, and I'd like to call on cricket fans here to come out and support us during the Asia Cup"

**Sharjah saw the ball favour spin quite a bit in the tri-series. What do you expect from the conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi?**  
In Dubai, there will be assistance for spinners, especially in the middle overs. Not so much in Abu Dhabi. The conditions remain the same in both innings. Maybe in the afternoon game, there is a difference because you get some swing early on under natural light. It also tends to stick in the wicket. But under lights, the ball comes onto the bat beautifully.

**In the UAE squad, there are plenty of expats who come to watch games, but they're usually there to support the visiting team, be it India, Pakistan, or Afghanistan? If UAE cricket gets to a higher level, do you think you'll also find home support?**  
It'll take time. Five years ago, only your mates and your parents came to watch you here. Now, we see crowds coming to watch and support us. In the matches coming up, we can expect some support, and I'd like to call on cricket fans here to come out and support us during the Asia Cup.

**Bat first or chase?**  
Outside the UAE, we can bat first and defend totals because we bowl well. But in the UAE, you get dew in the second innings, and high humidity makes it difficult to grip the ball. In my opinion, chasing in UAE is a little bit easier than batting first. That's why we aim to chase. In that first game against Afghanistan if we'd applied ourselves just a little bit more and used our experience we could have won that game easily.

**Is Haider Ali your prime wicket-taking bowler? Who else should we be aware of?**  
Haider's played first-class cricket in Pakistan and has been bowling well here for past four or five years. Dhruv Parashar too bowls very well here. We suffered a real blow when one of our spinners Zuhaib Zubair got injured; he was our second-highest wicket-taker behind Haider in Entebbe. He's out of Asia Cup with shoulder injury unfortunately; that puts onus even more on Haider to continue step up.

**What's your experience of captaining a side with different cultures like is case with UAE team?**  
It's not much of a challenge because we play together every other day. We see each other all time; boys get along very well so it isn't much issue managing this group. I know now how use our bowlers because I know this team so well given time I've spent with them captained them.

To take you back a bit you were born Central Punjab Pakistan How did you end up UAE?  
I began playing cricket Pakistan; used play Multan Region didn't get much chance though moved here 2016-17 had friend who played for team here used play local cricket not quite level formal domestic cricket more like club cricket.

Ramadan is cricket season he invited me here at that time started then did well from there got involved equivalent first-class cricket structure UAE started playing that after few years success made debut UAE 2021.

**What is pathway international cricket UAE? How do you make way into system?**  
The way get first of all have visa job or first-class-level team willing give employment contract sort out job as well accommodation but ICC rule have maintain residency country three years Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) follows performances how you've been doing get called few months ahead time become eligible if they have mind select national team that's what happened me.

**In four years since you've started playing international cricket how has UAE cricket evolved?**  
We were struggling start but last two three years we've been playing very good cricket last three years ILT20 has been huge help players because there are lot big-name players there places you different kind pressurised learning environment help learn things which prove useful international cricket.
