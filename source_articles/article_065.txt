# Aishwarya Rai's appeal to Delhi HC: 'Restrain people from using my name, images'

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

A bench of justice Tejas Karia also said that he would issue further directions for the takedown of URLs infringing upon the actor's personality rights.

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday indicated that it will pass an order protecting the misuse of Bollywood actor Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s personality and publicity rights by restraining various entities from commercially using her name, image, and voice without her consent.

A bench of justice Tejas Karia also said that he would issue further directions for the takedown of URLs infringing upon Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s personality rights.

“We’ll pass an order against each of the defendants (to take down the URLs), because prayers are broad. But we will grant injunctions separately,” Justice Karia said.

The high court expressed its intentions to safeguard the actor’s right, while dealing with a suit filed by her seeking protection of her name, image, person, voice and various other distinctive attributes of her personality.

Her suit, filed through advocates Pravin Anand and Dhruv Anand, stated that various entities were infringing her publicity and personality rights by using her name, voice, and video for illegal commercial purposes, and her image was also being morphed in various pornographic videos.

“Her name and image are being used to satisfy someone’s sexual desires,” senior advocate Sandeep Sethi representing the actor submitted.

To be sure, this is not the first time a Bollywood actor has approached the high court seeking protection of their personality and publicity rights.

In May last year, the court had safeguarded the personality and publicity rights of Bollywood veteran Jackie Shroff, observing that activities such as selling merchandise featuring him and creating distorted videos of the actor appeared, prima facie, to generate commercial gain through the “unauthorised exploitation” of his personality and publicity rights.

In 2023, the court had restrained the misuse of name, image, voice and other attributes of persona, including the “jhakaas” catchphrase of actor Anil Kapoor for commercial gain. In November 2022, the high court had also restrained persons at large from infringing veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan’s personality and publicity rights.

# Aishwarya Rai Bachchan urges Delhi HC to restrain people from unauthorisedly using her name, images and AI-generated porn content

Actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has urged Delhi High Court to restrain people from unauthorisedly using her name, images and AI-generated porn content.

During the hearing, the Delhi HC orally indicated that it will pass an ad-interim order against the defendant entities.

According to Live Law, senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, who represented Aishwarya Rai in the court, told Justice Tejas Karia that his client was seeking enforcement of her publicity and personality rights.

Sandeep Sethi also presented a few websites and said that the former beauty queen had not authorised it, the website further reported.

"Please see second defendant. Aishwarya Rai wallpapers, photos etc. The third defendant is a collection of T-shirts, her pictures on T-shirts are sold," he showed in the court according to Live Law.

Sethi said that many websites are making monetary gains in the name of Aishwarya Rai.

"They are collecting money on the representation of my association. Screenshots on YouTube where images morphed, these are never images belonging to Aishwarya Rai. Neither she has authorised such images. All AI generated," he said.

He also presented before the court that there were many intimate photographs of his client being used "which are completely unreal" and AI generated.

Sethi further said that some of them were using Aishwarya's images to sell coffee mugs and other articles.

Aishwarya Rai was also represented through advocates Pravin Anand and Dhruv Anand.

The high court listed the matter for further proceedings before the joint registrar on November 7 and before the court on January 15, 2026. (With PTI inputs)

# 'My name is being used to satisfy someone's desires': Aishwarya Rai moves HC for protection against AI-generated porn content

Bollywood actor Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has approached the Delhi High Court seeking protection of her personality rights and an order against unauthorised use of her name, images, and AI-generated pornographic material. The matter came up on Tuesday before Justice Tejas Karia, who orally indicated that an ad-interim order cautioning the defendants would be passed, a PTI report stated.

Senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, appearing for Rai, told the court that completely unreal intimate images of the actor were being circulated online. 

"There can be no right in their favour to use her images, likeness or persona. A gentleman is collecting money merely by putting my name and face," Sethi argued.

"Her name and likeness is being used to satisfy someone's sexual desires. This is very unfortunate," he said.

Rai was also represented by advocates Pravin Anand and Dhruv Anand.

The high court has listed the matter for further proceedings before the joint registrar on November 7 and for hearing before the court on January 15, 2026.
