Rajyalaxmi Chitrakar, the wife of former Nepali Prime Minister Jhalanath Khanal, has been killed in a fire set at their house by protesters, according to a report.

The development has come in the midst of nationwide protests in Nepal where mobs are continuously attacking government buildings, politicians’ homes, and political parties’ offices, and setting them ablaze.

Nepali outlet Khabar Hub reported that a mob trapped Chitrakar inside the house and set the building on fire.

The report quoted family sources as saying that Chitrakar was taken to the Kirtipur Burn Hospital in critical condition but she succumbed to her injuries during treatment.

There has not been any official confirmation of her death. Firstpost cannot independently verify the death.

Throughout the day, mobs have set ablaze some of the most recognisable buildings of the country, such as the Singh Durbar in Kathmandu, which is the seat of the Nepali government, and Sheetal Niwas, the presidential residence. They have also burnt private homes of President Ram Chandra Paudel, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, former Prime Ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and Sher Bahadur Deuba. Mobs have also attacked offices of political parties.

In the attack on Deuba’s home, he and his wife, foreign minister Arzu Rana Deuba, were also reportedly assaulted.

According to family members, a group of protesters allegedly forced her inside the residence before igniting the blaze. She was rushed to Kirtipur Burn Hospital in critical condition where she is now undergoing treatment.

Former Nepal Prime Minister Jhalanath Khanal’s wife, Rabi Laxmi Chitrakar, is undergoing treatment and her condition is improving, said Khanal’s personal secretary Krishna Bhattarai while sharing her health update. Chitrakar had suffered severe burn injuries after her house was set ablaze, reportedly by protesters during the ongoing Gen Z revolt.

“Madam’s health has improved,” Bhattarai shared her health update with Nepal's 'Kantipur Daily'. She is undergoing treatment at Kirtipur Burn Hospital.

The attack comes as violent Gen-Z-led protests continued in Nepal for the second day despite the government announcing that it had lifted the ban on social media platforms. Demonstrators demanded Oli's ouster and the government's dismissal after two more people were killed on the second day of the demonstrations, pushing the death toll to 22 and leaving over 300 injured.

Major government and political landmarks across Nepal have come under attack as mobs set fire to Singh Durbar, the central administrative complex in Kathmandu, and Sheetal Niwas, the presidential residence. Residence of President Ram Chandra Paudel, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, and former premiers Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and Sher Bahadur Deuba were also torched.

In the assault on Deuba’s residence, he and his wife, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba, were reportedly attacked. Offices of political parties have also been targeted amid the escalating unrest.

As violent protests over the government's social media ban intensified, Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned, his aide Prakash Silwal confirmed. In his resignation letter, Oli said he was stepping down "to facilitate a solution to the problem and to help resolve it politically".

According to army sources, Oli had earlier spoken to Nepal Army Chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel, seeking military assistance to control the worsening situation and to ensure his safe exit from the Prime Minister's residence. The Army Chief reportedly advised him to step down, saying the military could only stabilise the situation if he relinquished power.
