# 'Vampires sucking blood dry': Peter Navarro hits out at India, China and BRICS

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Peter Navarro doubted if the alliance between the BRICS bloc would stay for long, asserting that none of them "would survive without selling to the US".

Another day, another attack on India by White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, this time with a reference to "vampires". After days of lashing out at India's oil trade with Russia, Navarro has now targeted the countries in the BRICS bloc, that India is also a part of.

In a TV interaction, Peter Navarro doubted if the alliance between bloc of countries would stay for long, asserting that none of them "would survive without selling to the United States".

"...when they sell to the US their exports they are like vampires sucking our blood dry with their unfair trade practices," Navarro said, further alleging that all countries part of the BRICS union historically "hate each other and kill each other".

Earlier during the same remarks, Peter Navarro also slammed the ties between India and China, claiming the two countries have been “at war for decades”.

The BRICS bloc started out with Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. In 2024, the bloc expanded and was joined by Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, and the latest member Indonesia in 2025.

Peter Navarro's “vampire” dig at BRICS countries comes months after he made similar remarks against China in context of the United Kingdom.

"If the Chinese vampire can't suck the American blood, it is going to suck the UK blood and the EU blood," Navarro was quoted as saying by the Telegraph back in May.

Navarro had warned the UK to not become a “dumping ground” for Chinese goods, and not be "an all too complaint servant of the Chinese Communist Party".

His remarks had come when the tariff row between the US and China was raging, with Trump's announcement of a 245 per cent tariff on Chinese goods, and Beijing hitting back with 125 per cent duties. Both countries had later reached an agreement to temporarily lower the levies.

Navarro's post on India gets fact checked on X

As Peter Navarro continues his tirade against India, one of the posts made by the White House advisor's targeting India's oil trade with Russia was debunked on X.

In the post, he alleged that India was engaged in the deals to make a “profit” and “feed the Russia war machine”.

However, this community check resulted in a row between him and Elon Musk, who defended the platform and the fact-checking system saying, “People decide the narrative on this platform”.

"On this platform, the people decide the narrative. You hear all sides of an argument. Community Notes corrects everyone, no exceptions. Notes, data, and code is public source. Grok provides further fact-checking," Musk wrote in a post on X.

Navarro has been targeting India ever since US President Donald Trump's announcement of additional 25% tariffs on Indian imports, that took effect on August 27, taking the total duties to 50%.

The additional tariffs were announced as a penalty for India's oil trade with Russia.

# BRICS nations ‘vampires’ who are 'sucking the US blood dry' with unfair trade practices: Trump aide Peter Navarro

In an interview to 'Real America's Voice', which he shared on his X account, Navarro on Monday (US local time) said that the BRICS member countries cannot survive if they do not sell to the United States, with their exports affecting the Americans due to "unfair trade practices".  

He said in the interview, "... The bottomline is that none of these countries can survive if they don't sell to the United States, and when they sell to the United States their exports, they're like vampires sucking our blood dry with their unfair trade practices. Let's see what happens. But I don't see how the BRICS stays together since historically they all hate each other and kill each other."  

He raked up several examples where he tried to convince of the alliance not working out as the countries "historically they all hate each other and kill each other".  

Navarro said in the interview over the grouping, "Let's see how this is going to work out... Russia is getting into bed with China. China claims they own Vladivostok- the Russian port, and they're already through massive illegal immigration into Siberia, basically colonizing Siberia, which is the biggest landmass of the Russian semi-empire, so good luck with that, Putin, and then India, of course, is at war with China for decades... It was China that gave Pakistan a nuclear bomb. You got ships flying around the Indian Ocean now with Chinese flags. Modi, see how you kind of worked that out. Meanwhile, the Brazil economy is going down the tubes because of Lula's socialist policies- well, they keep the real leader of that country in a cell. Let's see what happens..."  

His remarks came after the BRICS virtual summit was hosted under the chairmanship of Brazil.  

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar represented PM Modi at the virtual summit.  

He underscored in a post on X that India's message was that BRICS should work towards stabilising the international economy, address the impact of ongoing conflicts on the Global South & proactively support reforming multilateralism.  

The President of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva highlighted that the virtual summit saw discussions on the need to advance towards a more "just, balanced, and inclusive international order, one capable of responding more effectively to the demands of the Global South".  

The BRICS members reaffirmed their commitment towards preserving and strengthening multilateralism and reforming international institutions, he noted in his post.  

"We will remain committed to actively contributing to peace and to building collective solutions for global challenges", the Brazilian President wrote on X.  

The BRICS is a group formed by eleven countries: Brasil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Iran, as described by the official website for BRICS 2025. It as a political and diplomatic coordination forum for countries from the Global South and for coordination in the most diverse areas.
