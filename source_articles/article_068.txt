India ODI captain Rohit Sharma recently made a late-night visit to Kokilaben hospital on Monday, September 8, leaving the fans concerned. While it's not confirmed why Rohit visited the hospital, the curious fans have extended their wishes to the India legend. Rohit Sharma is all set to return to action during the three-match ODI series against Australia starting October 19.

The veteran has begun preparation for the big tour and also completed his mandatory fitness test at the Center of Excellence in Bengaluru. Rohit hasn't played for India since the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, where he led India to a win. Ahead of the England tour, he announced his retirement from Test cricket, but expressed a wish to play the World Cup 2027 for the Men in Blue.

The Australia tour will be make or break for Rohit Sharma, and even Virat Kohli. The India legends are eyeing a berth in the World Cup 2027 squad, but they are not guaranteed selections. Both Rohit and Kohli will have to prove their form and fitness for the World Cup by delivering decent performances in the preceding series.

Meanwhile, speculations are rife that Shubman Gill, not Rohit Sharma, will lead the Indian cricket team in Australia. With Rohit's future uncertain, rumours are doing rounds that the BCCI is seeing Shubman Gill as the potential candidate to replace Rohit Sharma as ODI captain. Gill also replaced Rohit as Test captain and made an immediate impact, scoring over 700 runs on the England tour where India drew the series 2-2.

In May 2025, Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from Test cricket after calling it quits from T20 internationals.

During a CEAT event, while he spoke on preparations for big moments, Rohit stated, as quoted by _PTI_ , "It is something that you prepare for, because the game demands longevity."

"Especially in the Test format, you have to last for five days. Mentally, it is very challenging and it is draining as well. But all cricketers have been brought up playing First-Class cricket."

"When we start playing cricket at a competitive level, even in Mumbai, club cricket (matches) go on for two days (or) three days so we are built like that and it starts at a very young age for us. It kind of makes it a little easier how to respond to situations that are there in front of you," he added.

According to Rohit, not all young players understand the importance of preparing well at the start of their careers.

He stated, "...when I started playing the sport, it was all about having fun, enjoying (it). As you go on, you start playing age group cricket and you kind of keep moving forward from that. Slowly, as you meet a lot of senior players (and) coaches, they talk about how important it is to prepare well," Rohit said.

"When you are very young, you don't understand the importance of preparation. But as you go along, you understand, it gives you a kind of discipline that the game asks for, so it starts with preparation, understanding what exactly you need to do," he said.
