# PhysicsWallah’s IPO prospectus features a rogue student and a flying slipper as risk—yes, really

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Hold tight for one of the quirkiest risks you’ll ever read in an IPO filing. In 2023, during a routine video class, a student at PhysicsWallah reportedly whipped out a slipper mid-call, brandishing it like a medieval weapon at a beleaguered faculty member. Yes, you read that right—chappal chaos in an ed-tech startup’s IPO filing.

PhysicsWallah’s Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) flags this bizarre incident as a serious operational and reputational risk, especially for their expanding offline centres. With a huge ₹3,820 crore IPO riding on their physical growth strategy, it seems the company might have to dodge more than just exam questions—potentially flying footwear too.

India’s ed-tech sector hasn’t had an easy ride lately. Heavyweights like Unacademy and Vedantu have trimmed staff, while Byju’s, once valued at a staggering $22 billion, is now struggling with insolvency pressures from US lenders.

PhysicsWallah, meanwhile, is betting on a hybrid model with a strong offline presence. Founders Alakh Pandey and Prateek Boob are set to offer significant stakes in their public market debut, hoping their viral popularity translates into investor confidence. But as the slipper incident shows, managing young students isn’t always textbook stuff.

Beyond the usual IPO risk list—think faculty turnover, competition and exam results—the prospectus reads like a reality TV script. From slipper-wielding students to “staff-pushing” incidents, the company is refreshingly upfront about the unpredictable challenges of running physical classrooms.

If PhysicsWallah can turn this flying slipper fiasco into sustained growth, it won’t just be a lesson in resilience—it might also teach investors how to duck the unexpected. One thing’s for sure: this IPO is far from dull.

# From slipper showdown to harassment: PhysicsWallah discloses unusual safety incidents in IPO filing

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

New Delhi, Sep 9 (PTI) A student allegedly threatened a PhysicsWallah teacher with a slipper during an online class in 2023 -- one of the several safety-related incidents revealed by the edtech unicorn in its updated draft papers filed ahead of its initial public offering (IPO).

The company said the episode highlighted the risks of disruptive behaviour as it expands into offline learning centres.

"Failure to protect students' safety and security may negatively impact our reputation and business," the company stated in its updated draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) filed last week.

PhysicsWallah also cited other troubling cases. In 2023, a video showing a staff member pushing a student at one of its offline centres circulated on social media. The staffer was later terminated following an internal probe.

Another serious case surfaced in June 2024, when a first information report (FIR) was lodged against a company employee after a ceiling fan fell on a student at a New Delhi centre. The charges involved negligent conduct and endangerment of safety, though the matter has since been settled and disposed of.

"In another incident in 2023, a student was seen threatening a faculty member with a slipper over a video call," the draft papers noted.

The company acknowledged that ensuring student welfare has become an area of concern for the education sector, amid growing reports of harassment and victimisation across institutions.

Founded in 2020, PhysicsWallah is looking to raise ₹3,820 crore through its initial public offering (IPO) comprising a fresh issue of equity shares worth ₹3,100 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of shares aggregating up to ₹720 crore by promoters.

Both promoters Alakh Pandey and Prateek Boob will each offload shares worth ₹360 crore through the OFS. At present, both hold 40.35 percent stake each in the company.

PhysicsWallah offers test preparation courses for competitive exams focusing on JEE, NEET, GATE and UPSC along with upskilling programs, delivered through online platforms (YouTube, website, and apps), tech-enabled offline centers, and hybrid centers that combine online teaching with in-person support.

Its main YouTube channel, "Physics Wallah-Alakh Pandey," had about 13.7 million subscribers as of July 15, 2025, while its overall YouTube network had 98.8 million subscribers by June 30, 2025, growing at a CAGR of 41.8 per cent between FY23 and FY25. Apart from its strong digital presence, PhysicsWallah has also built a significant offline footprint.

The company, which is backed by WestBridge Capital, Hornbill, and GSV Ventures, narrowed its losses to ₹243 crore in the year ended March 2025 from ₹1,131 crore in the preceding year. However, revenue rose to ₹2,887 crore, up from ₹1,941 crore in the same period.

# Zerodha flags ‘unique risks’ in PhysicsWallah IPO filing: Flying slippers, falling ceiling fans

Online trading platform Zerodha has flagged what it calls a “unique risk” in the updated Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) filed by PhysicsWallah, one of India’s largest edtech companies, ahead of its Rs 3,820 crore initial public offering. While most IPO filings list standard risks like competition and regulatory hurdles, PhysicsWallah’s DRHP dives into a candid and unsettling territory: student safety incidents at its offline centres.

Taking to X, Zerodha highlighted the incidents mentioned in the document.  

PhysicsWallah has a unique risk

Among the incidents disclosed in the DRHP is a 2023 episode where a student allegedly threatened a faculty member with a slipper during a video call. Another case involved a staff member physically pushing a student at an offline centre — an act caught on video and widely circulated online. The company stated that the staff member was terminated following an internal assessment.

In a separate incident, a ceiling fan reportedly fell on a student at a New Delhi centre, leading to an FIR dated June 11, 2024, alleging negligent conduct and endangerment of life. The matter has since been settled, but PhysicsWallah acknowledged that such events could adversely affect its reputation and financial condition.

The surreal risk disclosure sparked reactions across X, with users commenting on the volatility of students and the broader implications for edtech safety.

“Hahaha — ‘the company could collapse if enough students threaten with chappal’,” wrote @lazy_proc. Another X user Suyog (@Yogiwasu) added that students are becoming highly volatile, while a third user Pawan Pandey (@PawanPandeyBgr) pointed out “The biggest risk is not mentioned — low quality teaching."

PhysicsWallah acknowledges risks, but offers no guarantees

In its DRHP, PhysicsWallah stated: “Failure to protect students’ safety and security may negatively impact our reputation and business.” The company added that while it has implemented safeguards to prevent harmful incidents, it cannot guarantee their effectiveness or rule out events beyond its control. The document also noted that safety breaches — including harassment by students or faculty — have occurred in the past and remain a concern for the industry.
