The Congress MP from Katihar was on a two-day visit to his parliamentary constituency.

Congress MP Tariq Anwar got a piggyback ride in Bihar’s Katihar during an inspection of flood-hit areas. A video of this has gone viral across social media platforms.

The video shows villagers wading through a waterlogged field while carrying Anwar, who was there to inspect flood-hit areas.

Reportedly, Anwar used several modes of transport from tractor to boat to commute through the flood-hit areas. However, the video in which villagers carried him has caught everyone’s attention.

Taking to X after visiting these places, Anwar wrote on Sunday, “Today, I inspected the flood-affected areas of Manihari and Barari. People are facing severe hardships due to flooding and river erosion. I stand with the affected families in this difficult time and appeal to the government for prompt relief and concrete solutions.”

Katihar district Congress president Sunil Yadav clarified that villagers themselves picked up the minister due to his ill health.

“We used a tractor, boat and bike to travel. During the inspection, our truck got stuck in the mud, and we had to walk around 2 km. It was extremely hot and Mr Anwar was feeling unwell; his head was spinning. As soon as he expressed this, the villagers picked him, purely out of love, and walked around,” he told NDTV.

In the now viral video, a villager can be seen carrying the Katihar MP on his back while the others hold him from the back. The video also shows police officers, with one of them supporting the gesture.

# "Unwell" Congress MP Tariq Anwar Carried By Villagers For Flood Inspection In Bihar

Congress MP Tariq Anwar got a piggyback ride in Bihar's Katihar during a 'flood inspection' drive. In a viral video, villagers can be seen wading through a waterlogged field while carrying Mr Anwar on their backs, who was there to inspect a flood-hit area. While the video has given room to a political row, Congress has come out in support of its minister and is defending by saying that Mr Anwar was "unwell."

Tariq Anwar, Congress MP from Katihar, was on a two-day visit to his parliamentary constituency, inspecting the impact of the flood. Mr Anwar used various modes of transport, including a tractor and a boat, to commute and inspect the region and meet people hit by the flood. But in one of the videos, Mr Anwar is seen being carried by villagers.

Katihar District Congress President Sunil Yadav said villagers themselves picked up the minister due to his ill health. Speaking to NDTV, Mr Yadav said, "We used a tractor, boat and bike to travel. During the inspection, our truck got stuck in the mud, and we had to walk around 2 km. It was extremely hot and Mr Anwar was feeling unwell; his head was spinning. As soon as he expressed this, the villagers picked him, purely out of love, and walked around."

In a video, a villager is seen carrying Mr Anwar on his back while others hold him from the back, ensuring he doesn't fall. A police officer is also visibly supporting the gesture.

Mr Anwar shared pictures and videos from the inspection drive on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) and said that he stands with the families affected by the flood. He also appealed to the government for immediate relief.

आज मैंने मनिहारी और बरारी के बाढ़ग्रस्त इलाकों का निरीक्षण किया। बाढ़ और नदी कटाव से लोग भारी कठिनाइयों का सामना कर रहे हैं। मैं इस मुश्किल घड़ी में प्रभावित परिवारों के साथ खड़ा हूँ और सरकार से शीघ्र राहत व ठोस समाधान की अपील करता हूँ।#Katihar #BiharFlood pic.twitter.com/rViJwI4FfF

Posting on social media platform 'X', Anwar wrote, “People are facing severe difficulties due to the floods and river erosion. I stand with the affected families and appeal to the government for prompt relief and concrete solutions.”

Local party officials said the MP was unwell and unable to walk through waterlogged patches, prompting villagers to carry him.

Katihar district Congress president Sunil Yadav said Anwar had gone to “understand the people’s problems” in remote flood-affected areas and was 'unwell'.

In a social media post on X, Poonawalla wrote, "Sense of entitlement of Congress. Even in flood affected areas they want VVIP protocol? Kharge ji insults farmers. Congress MP Tariq Anwar mocks flood relief - sits on shoulders of people while 'touring' flood affected areas. Congress MP in VVIP mode. Rahul Gandhi in Vacation Mode. AAP in hiding Mode. Only PM Modi in work mode."
