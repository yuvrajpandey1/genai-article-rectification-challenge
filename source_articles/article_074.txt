# BCCI announces schedule for India Women's home ODI series vs Australia

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has announced the schedule for India Women’s three-match ODI series against Australia. The matches will be held on September 14, 17, and 20 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. This series is part of both teams' preparations for the Women’s ODI World Cup later this year.

Chepauk returns to hosting a Women’s ODI for the first time since March 2007, when India, New Zealand, England, and Australia competed in a quadrangular series. More recently, the venue hosted a three-match T20I series and a one-off Test between India and South Africa last year.

India have had a strong year so far in the 50-over format. After defeating Ireland at home in January, the Women in Blue went on to win the tri-series in Sri Lanka, beating the hosts in the final. **Pratika Rawal has been a standout performer**, becoming the fastest woman to reach 500 ODI runs.

India have also introduced several new faces to their ODI setup. All-rounder Kashvee Gautam, left-arm spinners Sree Charani and Shuchi Upadhyay, and fast bowler Kranti Goud made their debuts during the Sri Lanka tri-series. Since the T20 World Cup held last year in the UAE, eight other players - including Tejal Hasabnis and Titas Sadhu - have also earned their ODI caps.

Next up, Harmanpreet Kaur’s team will tour England in June and July, playing five T20Is followed by three ODIs. Shafali Verma returns to the national side after being selected for the T20I squad, while **Sneh Rana is back in T20Is for the first time** in two years, following her Player of the Series performance in Sri Lanka.
