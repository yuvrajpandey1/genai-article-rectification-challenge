# Behind Nepal's Gen Z protests is a nepo-kid trigger

Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

A Gen Z Revolution of sorts is underway in the Himalayan nation of Nepal. On Monday, thousands of young people breached restricted zones in Kathmandu, breaking through police barricades, against the sweeping social media ban. However, the powerful outpouring of pent-up anger goes beyond the ban and has to do with systemic corruption and undue advantage that children of those in power—nepo kids and nepo babies—get. In the days leading up to Monday's protests, hashtags like #PoliticiansNepoBabyNepal, #NepoKids, and #NepoBaby trended on TikTok, Reddit, and some other social media platforms.

Online dissent spilled onto the streets on Monday, as anger over corruption and the social media ban together ignited mass protests against PM KP Sharma Oli's government in Nepal. The Oli government banned 26 social media apps on September 5. That seemed to be the trigger for the latest crisis in which at least 20 people have been killed.

The anger against the political nepo kids was on display as Gen Z Nepalis clashed with security personnel. The term nepo kid comes from nepotism.

"The leaders' children return from abroad with Gucci bags, the people's children in coffins," read a placard held by a youngster. The 'coffin' remark may allude to the return of deceased Nepali citizens to their homeland. Severe poverty and high youth unemployment, around 19.2% among those aged 15–29, drove many young Nepalis to work as mercenaries in the Ukraine-Russia war.

The Nepalese Army has been deployed across Kathmandu, and a curfew imposed, while protesters warned of even larger demonstrations.

### WITH VIRAL #NEPOKIDS, #NEPOBABY TRENDS, GEN Z IN NEPAL TAKES ON POLITICIANS' CHILDREN

The 'NepoKid' and 'NepoBaby' campaign, inspired by global discussions on the same, trended on TikTok and Reddit over the weekend, and electrified Nepal's youth.

Amid widespread economic hardship and corruption, Nepalis at home and abroad highlighted the lavish lifestyles of politicians' children in stark contrast to the struggles of ordinary citizens.

Viral TikTok videos contrasted images of elite kids flaunting designer clothes and foreign stays with the struggles of ordinary Nepalis, many of whom migrate for work. These migrant workers contribute to 33% of Nepal's GDP via remittances. Nepal's reliance on tourism, much of which is driven by social media visibility and promotion, means the ban also delivers a direct blow to its economy.

"Children of elite politicians know exactly where their parents' money and luxury come from—taxpayers like you and me. While we struggle, they live in utter privilege. Start listing their social media accounts and archiving their content to hold them accountable and prevent them from erasing the evidence," posted a person on Reddit's Nepal subreddit.

"Our taxes, their luxury... We pay, you flex," said another person.

"Nepo Kids show off their lifestyle on Instagram and TikTok, but never explain where the money comes from," a person on TikTok said in a widely shared video.

"People will expose you. They will take your photos from social media and show them publicly. This is not hate, this is accountability," Asheem Man Singh Basnyat, Managing Director of ride-hailing company Pathao, was quoted as saying by Kathmandu-based Republica newspaper.

Targets included the families of PM Oli, former PMs Sher Bahadur Deuba, and Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda'.

It's ironic that Prachanda's family members are being branded nepo kids. Prachanda, a Maoist, was at the forefront of an insurgency that led to the toppling of King Gyanandra Shah's regime in 2008.

The protesters also accuse these nepo kids of benefiting from corrupt earnings, which aligns with the broader anti-corruption theme of the agitation.

"Gen Z has framed corruption and inequality differently... While older generations talked about asset investigations and nationalisation, Gen Z is comparing leaders' children's lifestyles with the daily struggles of ordinary citizens. This is a creative and powerful way to show inequality," Nepalese sociologist Dipesh Ghimire told ICT Magazine.

He described the Gen Z movement as a potent "bugle call against the ruling system", and hailed it a creative "punch" by a generation that has grown up with social media as their main tool for communication and activism.

### NEPO KID CAMPAIGN MERGES WITH SOCIAL MEDIA BAN PROTESTS IN NEPAL

The nepo kid campaign soon gained momentum alongside outrage over the Oli government's September 4 ban on 26 social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and YouTube, for failing to register with the Ministry of Communications.

While Oli has defended the ban as a matter of "national dignity" and regulatory compliance, protesters see it as censorship to silence dissent, particularly campaigns exposing elite privilege.

Reacting to the social media ban, X-user Princi Koirala said, "Government of Nepal is a classic case of toxic parenting".

The Gen Z, and digital natives of Nepal, view the ban as an attempt to suppress their voices. Videos juxtaposing leaders' children with ordinary citizens' struggles have fuelled public anger.

As a result, thousands of Gen Z protesters, many in school uniforms, marched from Kathmandu's Maitighar Mandala to Parliament, chanting against corruption and the social media ban on Monday.

"We are protesting against corruption that has been institutionalised in Nepal," protester Yujan Rajbhandari told news agency AFP.

The Kathmandu Post reported violent clashes took place as demonstrators broke barricades, prompting police to use tear gas, water cannons, and live fire. It resulted in 16 deaths and injuries to over 80 people.

Kathmandu Mayor Balen Shah and celebrities like Madan Krishna Shrestha and Hari Bansha Acharya have also voiced their support for the protestors, which could amplify the protests further. Many celebs have donated to the cause.

The leaderless movement, dubbed 'The Final Revolution', is demanding transparency and accountability. While Oli insists the social media ban protects national sovereignty, critics argue it shields corrupt elites. With public support growing, including endorsements from Nepalese celebrities, the Gen Z-led uprising tells a tale of a generational shift that now challenges Nepal's post-monarchical status quo.

# “Nepo kid” trend sparks anti-corruption campaign in Nepal

Published at : September 6, 2025

A social media trend, “Nepo Kid”, has spread rapidly in Nepal in recent days, as young people accuse the children of politicians and influential figures of enjoying privileges funded by corruption.

The campaign, which has gained traction on platforms such as TikTok and Reddit, labels sons and daughters of political leaders as “Nepo Kids” and questions their lifestyles.

Users have shared images and videos showing luxury cars, foreign education and lavish holidays, contrasting them with the struggles of ordinary citizens who often migrate abroad for jobs.

The terms “Nepo Kid,” and “Nepo Baby,” are derived from nepotism, meaning opportunities gained through family ties rather than merit. It first became widely used in Hollywood and Bollywood to describe the children of film stars, and was later adopted in the Philippines in a campaign highlighting the children of politicians.

In Nepal, it is now being used to target the families of former prime ministers, ministers, lawmakers, leaders, and other influential personalities.

Reddit users have accused political families of misusing taxpayers’ money. “When you see politicians’ children, it feels like taxpayers’ money has funded their luxury cars, foreign education and lifestyle, while ordinary youths are forced to work hard abroad,” one post read.

Videos with the hashtag #PoliticiansNepoBabyNepal circulated on TikTok question whether politicians’ children achieved success through their own effort or through their parents’ power and wealth. Some videos highlight children of diplomats and lawmakers receiving special privileges.

The posts reflect public anger over entrenched corruption and widening inequality.

“Nepo Kids show off their lifestyle on Instagram and TikTok, but never explain where the money comes from,” one TikTok user said in a widely shared video.

Reddit discussions suggest the campaign is likely to spill onto the streets. Some users have called for protests in Baneshwar and other parts of the country, saying Generation Z is “waking up” and that online campaigns should be followed by physical demonstrations.

The government has restricted social media access in recent days, but organisers said they plan to move ahead with street protests from Monday.

Not all youths agree with the campaign. Some say targeting children for their parents’ actions risks cyberbullying.

“It is unfair for children to be punished for their parents’ mistakes. This can have a negative effect on their personal lives,” one TikTok user said.

The online campaign continues to grow, and activists say they will continue raising questions about political families and their lifestyles.
