# Nepal protests: India asks its nationals in Nepal to exercise caution

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Nepal protests: At least 19 people were killed and 400 injured in Nepal’s biggest protests in recent history, triggered by a social media ban and fueled by anger over corruption and economic woes. Though the government lifted the ban, demonstrations continued across Kathmandu and beyond, demanding accountability. India’s foreign ministry advised citizens to exercise caution amid the unrest.

The Ministry of External Affairs on Tuesday advised Indians to exercise caution and adhere to the steps and guidelines issued by Nepali authorities. This comes a day after protests over a ban on major social media platforms in the neighbouring country killed at least 19 people.  

"We are closely monitoring the developments in Nepal since yesterday and are deeply saddened by the loss of many young lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with families of deceased. We also wish speedy recovery for those who were injured."  

The ministry said, as a close friend and neighbour, "We hope that all concerned will exercise restraint and address any issues through peaceful means and dialogue."  

"We have also taken note that authorities have imposed curfew in Kathmandu and several other cities of Nepal. Indian nationals in Nepal are advised to exercise caution and adhere to the steps and guidelines issued by the Nepali authorities."  

In the latest round of developments, Nepal's government has retreated from its ban. By Tuesday morning, all 26 of the platforms that the government blocked last week, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and WeChat, were back online. But protesters were back on the street despite a curfew, demanding that government officials be punished and replaced.  

The protests, which were fueled by anger over corruption and a weak economy as well as the social media ban, have been the most widespread in Nepal's recent history. The security forces' violent response has only added to the pressure on the government. Opposition parties and some members of the governing coalition have called for Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli to resign.  

In the capital, Kathmandu, protesters surged toward the parliament complex Monday, occupying a security post before being dispersed by police, according to witnesses. It was not immediately clear how those who died were killed, or how hundreds of others were wounded, but witnesses said authorities had used live ammunition against the crowd, in addition to rubber bullets and water cannons.  

The demonstrators, who appeared to be mostly teenagers and young adults, have embraced the label "Gen Z protest." A Nepalese official acknowledged their youth in disclosing that the government would retreat from its move against more than two dozen social media platforms.  

"To address the demands raised by Gen Z, a social media ban will be lifted," Prithvi Subba Gurung, minister for communication and information technology, said in an interview with The New York Times late Monday.  

The ban went into effect Thursday for platforms that officials said had failed to comply with new requirements to register with the government.  

It was not just the social media ban that sent protesters spilling into the streets of the capital and around Nepal. Outrage has also been growing over economic inequality and what many Nepalese see as the government's failure to aggressively pursue high-profile corruption cases.  

Local news media reported that at least 400 people have been injured in the unrest.  

As protesters in Kathmandu clashed with law enforcement officers, authorities forbade gatherings in the area around the parliament complex. The demonstrations continued, however, with protesters blocking highways as troops and paramilitary forces deployed by the government struggled to control the crowds.  

Oli held an emergency Cabinet meeting Monday at which the home affairs minister said he would resign.  

Mr. Gurung suggested that the protests had been infiltrated, exacerbating tensions, without naming anyone or any group. He said an investigation was underway.  

Some in Nepal have suggested that supporters of the monarchy, which was abolished in 2008, may have helped foment the unrest. Protests in March demanding restoration of royal rule led to at least two deaths. But the demonstrations Monday were far larger.  

"This may be the most violent social and political unrest in modern Nepal," said Professor Jeevan Sharma, chair of South Asia and International Development at the University of Edinburgh, who is in Nepal conducting research.  

Sharma said the social media ban had created "overwhelming anger" and had "curtailed democratic space and freedom of expression."  

The protests spread to other parts of Nepal, including Pokhara in the country's center, the Chitwan district in the southwest and Janakpur, southeast of the capital.  

In Kathmandu, eight people died after being taken to the National Trauma Center, according to Dipendra Pandey, a doctor there. At Kathmandu Medical College, two others died, and 28 others arrived with injuries, according to another doctor, Bibek Limbu. Three people from the protests died at Civil Service Hospital, according to its executive director, Dr. Mohan Chandra Regmi.  

"Our emergency ward is overloaded," Regmi said.

# India asks citizens to avoid Nepal travel, those there to avoid stepping out

India has advised its citizens in Nepal to avoid travel and shared helpline numbers for those stranded in the Himalayan nation after violent Gen Z protests left at least 22 dead and prompted curfews in several cities.

As violent anti-government protests continue in Nepal for the second day, India on Tuesday advised its citizens to avoid travelling to the Himalayan nation until the situation stabilised there. New Delhi also issued helpline numbers for those who are stranded in the neighbouring country.

In the advisory issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), all Indian citizens in Nepal were advised to shelter in their current places of residence, avoid going out onto the streets and exercise all due caution.

"They are also advised to follow local safety advisories from Nepal authorities as well as the Embassy of India in Kathmandu. In case of any assistance required, please call the Embassy of India, Kathmandu, on the following helpline numbers - +977 – 980 860 2881 (WhatsApp call also) and +977 – 981 032 6134 (WhatsApp call also)," the advisory said.

The fresh advisory came as Nepal plunged into chaos on Monday with Gen Zers leading huge protests across the Himalayan nation against the government's earlier move to ban 26 social media platforms. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned today amid protests as protesters attacked and set fire to private residences of several top politicians, and vandalised the parliament.

Violent clashes between protesters and security forces have left 22 people dead and over 350 injured.

Earlier today, the MEA said India had been closely monitoring the developments in Nepal since yesterday and expressed sorrow over the loss of young lives. "We are closely monitoring the developments in Nepal since yesterday and are deeply saddened by the loss of many young lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the deceased. We also wish a speedy recovery for those who were injured," the statement said.

"We have also taken note that the authorities have imposed a curfew in Kathmandu and several other cities of Nepal. Indian nationals in Nepal are advised to exercise caution and adhere to the steps and guidelines issued by the Nepali authorities," it said.

Describing India as a "close friend and neighbour", the statement also called on all parties in Nepal to exercise restraint and resolve disputes through dialogue.

Meanwhile, several Indian airlines, including Air India and IndiGo, have cancelled all flights operating to and from Kathmandu due to the prevailing situation.

Air India on Tuesday cancelled four flights between Delhi and Kathmandu. Air India operates six flights a day between Delhi and Kathmandu.

"In view of the current situation prevailing in Kathmandu, the following flights AI2231/2232, AI2219/2220, AI217/218 and AI211/212 operating on the Delhi-Kathmandu-Delhi route have been cancelled today. We are closely monitoring the situation and will share further updates,” an Air India spokesperson said.

IndiGo and Nepal Airlines also cancelled their flights from Delhi to Kathmandu on Tuesday as the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu has been temporarily closed.

"In view of the prevailing situation in Kathmandu, the airport has been closed for operations. Consequently, all flights to and from Kathmandu stand suspended as of now. If your travel is impacted, you may conveniently opt for an alternate flight or claim a refund by visiting our website," IndiGo said in a statement.

The unrest erupted after Nepal's government banned 26 social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and X, prompting mass demonstrations, particularly by the Gen Z population. The KP Sharma Oli-led government clarified its stance that the social media sites were banned to bring them under regulation.

Despite this, the protests turned violent as some demonstrators clashed with police, forcing authorities to deploy the Nepali Army to secure key roads around the parliament complex in New Baneshwor.

In view of the deadliest youth uprising in years, Nepal Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak resigned and other ministers from the Oli cabinet resigned amid the protests.

Hours later, the government succumbed to pressure from Gen Zers and withdrew its earlier decision to ban the social media platforms. Nepal's Ministry of Information had instructed agencies to restore access to the blocked sites.
