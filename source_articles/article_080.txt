# Asia Cup: Sediqullah, Omarzai fifties carry Afghanistan to 188/6 against HK

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Abu Dhabi, Sep 9 (PTI) Well-paced fifties by Sediqullah Atal and Azmatullah Omarzai helped Afghanistan tide over their top-order batters’ struggle against pace-off deliveries of Hong Kong bowlers, and make a healthy 188 for six in the Asia Cup opener here on Tuesday.

Atal (73 not out off 52 balls) and Omarzai (53 off 21 balls) judged the nature of the pitch to perfection, and played accordingly while waiting for their chances to free the arm.

The left-handed opener began with a slew of boundaries against new ball in the Power Play segment once Afghanistan opted to bat first, but soon settled into a calmer tempo.

He fetched his fifty, third in T20Is, in 41 balls, and between the 5th and 13th over, there was only one big shot — a pull off off-spinner Kinchit Shah over mid-wicket for a six.

Shah deserved a special mention for tying up the usually hard-hitting Afghan batters with a series of under-cutters, that they failed either to read or work around for singles.

Mohammad Nabi (33 off 26 balls) took a few balls to find his range, but once he slipped into the rhythm the veteran all-rounder hammered pacer Aizaz Khan for a four and six in successive balls.

But that proved a false dawn as Nabi fell to Shah while trying to clear the long-off fielder.

Nizakat Khan took a simple catch to end the promising 51 runs stand for the third wicket and soon the Afghans were struggling at 95 for four after 13 overs.

Atal had a big slice of fortune too when Ehsan Khan dropped a dolly at short third man off left-arm spinner Yasim Murtaza.

The Afghan batter was on 51 then and he punished Hong Kong bowlers adding 82 runs for the fifth wicket with Omarzai, who clobbered pacer Ayush Shukla for 6, 6, 6, and 4 in successive balls of the 19th over.

Atal plundered pacer Ateeq Iqbal for two consecutive sixes — over long on and square leg respectively — and then a paddle sweep for four as Afghanistan found some late momentum, milking 25 runs from the 17th over.

Overall, Hong Kong also struggled with their fielding in the later stages of the innings, as they dropped Omarzai as well. PTI UNG ATK

# Atal, Omarzai muscle Afghanistan to 188 for 6 in Asia Cup opener

Sediqullah Atal and Azmatullah Omarzai struck half-centuries each to carry Afghanistan to 188 for 6 in the opening match of the men's T20 Asia Cup. Hong Kong had their moments, their spinners in particular harnessing slow conditions well enough to frustrate their more pedigreed opponents. But the gulf in class eventually showed as Yasin Murtaza's side dropped catches and committed misfields to hurt their own chances.

Sediqullah has brought up each of this three T20I fifties in his last four innings, and as well as he looked out in the middle, standing tall at the crease and largely coping with the lack of pace, he benefited from three missed chances. A man who could've been dismissed in the very first over in the end batted through to finish on 73 off 52.

Murtaza was involved in all three lives Sediqullah got - twice dropping the catch himself and once having to watch it go down off his own bowling. He did the best he could to make up for it, the three Hong Kong spinners giving the ball such little pace but so much air that this game looked straight out of the 90s. As such, the more modern day T20 batter wasn't able to adjust. Murtaza, Ehsan Khan and Kinchit Shah picked up 3 for 75 in 11 overs.

However, the arrival of pace in the 17th over changed the game with Atal and Omarzai targeting Ayush Shukla. Afghanistan scored 69 runs in the last four overs with Omarzai raising his first T20I half-century. From the simple clear-the-front-leg slog to the cheeky ramp past the keeper, the Afghanistan allrounder has shown impressive range on a difficult batting pitch and finished with a strike rate of 252.38.

Should Hong Kong chase the target down, it would be their highest successful T20I chase.
