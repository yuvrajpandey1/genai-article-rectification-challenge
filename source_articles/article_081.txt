# GHMC Issues Notice To Allu Arjun's Family Over Illegal Construction At Business Park Building: Reports

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

A fresh controversy has surfaced for superstar Allu Arjun and his family after the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) issued a notice to the Allu Business Park building in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad, citing illegal construction.

On Monday (September 8), GHMC's Circle-18 authorities served a show-cause notice to the actor and his family, questioning why the unauthorised structure should not be demolished. According to media reports, the notice was issued by Circle-18 Deputy Commissioner Sammaiah following an inspection of the property.

Reportedly, the construction was originally permitted on a plot measuring 1,226 square yards, with approval granted for two cellars and ground plus four floors. However, GHMC officials found that an illegal extension had been carried out on the fourth floor without prior approval.

Taking cognisance of the violation, the GHMC reportedly demanded an explanation from Allu Arjun's family, asking them to justify the unauthorised construction. Failure to provide a satisfactory response could result in the demolition of the extended portion, the notice warns.

The Allu Business Park, located on Road No. 45 in Jubilee Hills, was constructed two years ago by the Allu family. The building serves as the hub for Geetha Arts, Allu Arts, and several other associated businesses.

The matter is currently under review, and Allu Arjun's family is yet to issue an official response to the allegations.

This development comes at a time when Allu Arjun has been in the spotlight both for his professional achievements and public image.

Icon Star Allu Arjun's family faces legal trouble as the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) issued a notice regarding illegal construction at Allu Business Park in Jubilee Hills. The GHMC alleges unauthorized extensions on the fourth floor, violating the sanctioned plan. Deputy Commissioner Sammaiah has ordered an inquiry into the matter.

Icon Star Allu Arjun currently finds himself in a legal tussle with the civic authorities in Hyderabad. As per the latest report, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation has issued a notice against the 'Pushpa' actor's family for illegal construction at the Allu Business Park building in Jubilee Hills.

According to an India Today report, the GHMC Circle-18 authorities have served a show-cause notice regarding the extension made on the fourth floor of the commercial complex without making the necessary approvals. The report suggests that the building, which is located on Road no. 45 in Jubilee Hills, was sanctioned on a plot measuring 1,226 square yards, and the permission was allowed for two cellars and ground plus four floors.

However, the officials allege that an additional structure was constructed on the fourth floor recently. Hence, it violates the sanctioned plan.

The matter is being overseen by Deputy Commissioner Sammaiah, who has called for an inquiry into the case, asking his team to take immediate action.

For the unversed, the Allu Business Park was built two years ago and includes the offices of Geetha Arts, Allu Arts-related businesses, and other companies.

So far, neither Allu Arjun nor his family members have issued a statement addressing the controversy.

Speaking of Allu Arjun's work front, after the mammoth success of 'Pushpa 2: The Rule,' he is now gearing up for a mega sci-fi action adventure film tentatively named 'AA22xA6,' joining hands with 'Jawan' director Atlee. The movie also stars Deepika Padukone as the female lead and will also feature Mrunal Thakur, Janhvi Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna, and others who are said to be a part of the film.

The film is currently being shot in Mumbai.
