# Wake Up Dead Man adds a delightfully dark twist to Knives Out

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

When director Rian Johnson introduced the new _Knives Out_ film on the third day of TIFF 2025, he exclaimed: “we’re going back to church.”

By that he meant that _Wake Up Dead Man_ , the latest Benoit Blanc mystery, would harken back to the origins of the whodunit, and in particular the gothic vibes of Edgar Allan Poe. And now that I’ve seen it, I have to say that Johnson pulled it off: the new movie has a darker and more spiritual feel than its predecessors, and yet it’s still distinctly _Knives Out_ , which is to say twisting and hilarious. I gasped a few times, as did the rest of audience, at the many reveals. I’ll have a full review in the coming days, but you can read my initial thoughts below.

In addition to that, I managed to watch a tense German film about the dark side of being an influencer, a Saudi crime thriller with a deflating twist, a hilarious dark comedy about how terrible kids can be, and the best pure action flick I’ve seen in some time. It was a hectic and eclectic day to say the least. (Unfortunately most of these movies don’t currently have premiere dates for a wider audience, but I’ll let you know if that changes.)

And if you missed them, you can read my previous dispatches from this year’s TIFF as well, covering films like _Exit 8_ and _No Other Choice_.

## _Wake Up Dead Man_

Benoit Blanc’s (Daniel Craig) third outing is the darkest and most complex yet. It covers a murder in a small church community in New York, as Blanc pairs up with a young priest (Josh O’Connor) and the local sheriff (Mila Kunis) to figure out what’s going on. Of course it’s not so simple; in fact, Blanc constantly calls the case “impossible.” But that complexity allows the film to build up an incredible cascade of twists and turns that seems to just keep going up until reaching a powerfully emotional crescendo. And don’t worry: even though the tone is more dire and serious at times, this also might be the funniest _Knives Out_ has ever been.

## _The Furious_

An absolutely unrelenting and bone-crunching action movie starring Xie Miao and Joe Taslim as two men fighting to take down an underground child-trafficking ring. Each fight sequence is as brutal as it is balletic, and yet there’s an inventiveness and playfulness to it as well. Nearly everything can be part of the choreography, whether it’s duelling with bicycles as if they were swords, or downed foes becoming a human pyramid to climb. If you want an idea of how extra this movie can be, imagine a classic hallway fight just _teeming_ with bad guys, and then add a motorcycle. The final sequence, between five men with different aims, is chaotic, exhausting, and impossible to look away from.

## _Babystar_

As an only child, Luca (Maja Bons) is the centerpiece of a wildly successful influencer family. Nearly every important moment in her life has happened in front of a camera; she learned about periods from her mom on a podcast. She’s rich but alone, and when her parents move ahead with plans to have another child — spurred, it seems, primarily by the content opportunities — Luca starts to question the life she’s been forced into. Early on the movie feels suffocating in a good way, mirroring how Luca feels. But it never quite figures out how to direct that energy, and the story meanders to a conclusion while mostly wasting a subplot about Luca’s AI avatar.

##  _Bad Apples_

It really seems like everything would be OK for school teacher Maria (Saoirse Ronan) if she didn’t have to deal with the one problem child in her class. And then, one day he does really go away — I won’t spoil the why or how — and her life does get better, as does the rest of the class, who thrive once they have a teacher who isn’t stressed all day. But the unhinged twist in _Bad Apples_ lingers, and the film becomes such a funny romp as Maria tries to balance doing the right thing with working towards the greater good.

## ** _Unidentified_**

This movie starts out well, before blowing it with a twist that feels cheap and implausible. Nawal (Mila Alzahrani) is a receptionist for the police, but also a true crime addict, so when she’s asked to help out with a case of a murder girl, she becomes obsessed. The complications that arise from an unauthorized woman trying to solve a crime in Saudi Arabia add an interesting twist to the genre, and the mystery is enjoyable right up until the ending, which I won’t spoil, only to say that it undoes the goodwill the rest of the film creates.

# Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery review – whodunnit threequel is murderously good fun

Published Date: Sunday September 07, 2025

**Toronto film festival:** after Glass Onion underwhelmed, Rian Johnson’s self-aware, star-packed Benoit Blanc series makes a barnstorming return to form

If Glass Onion wasn’t quite the deserving follow-up to Knives Out that many of us had hoped it would be (it was more focused on the bigger rather than better), it was at the very least a deserved victory lap. Writer-director Rian Johnson’s 2019 whodunnit brought us back to the starry, slippery fun of the 70s and 80s, when films like this would be a dime a dozen and it was a surprise hit, making almost eight times its budget at the global box office. While Kenneth Branagh had seen commercial success already with his Poirot revival two years prior, his retreads felt too musty, and the actor-director too miscast, for the genre to truly feel like it was entering an exciting new period.

Johnson’s threequel, Wake Up Dead Man, is the second as part of his Netflix deal (one that cost an estimated $450m) and arrives as the whodunnit genre has found itself close to oversaturation on both big but mostly small screen. Yet as many murders as there might have now been in buildings or residences involving couples and strangers of questionable perfection, nothing has quite captured that same sense of kicky, sharp-witted fun that Johnson had shared with us way back when. His first Knives Out film premiered at the Toronto film festival to one of the most buzzed audience reactions I can remember, a thrill I was able to feel once again as he returned to unveil his latest chapter, a rip-roaring return to form that shows the series to be confidently back on track and heading somewhere with plenty more places to go on the way.

In his introduction, Johnson spoke of the versatility within the whodunnit genre and while this is another assemblage of famous names all facing suspicion from Daniel Craig’s master detective Benoit Blanc again, he told us this one would be a gothic tale with inspiration from Edgar Allen Poe and John Dickson Carr, the stormier dark to Glass Onion’s sunshiney light.

Craig’s second in command is played this time by Josh O’Connor, one of the few recent indie breakouts to find an equally convincing career in more mainstream fare, who stars as Jud, a boxer-turned-priest being handed a new position underneath a controversial small-town priest, played by Josh Brolin. His flock is faithful despite his cruel ways and Jud finds himself to be the rare outlier who can’t find anything worth praising. So when he’s killed in a baffling manner, Jud is the main suspect and he has to work with Benoit to find out the truth behind a murder that seems unsolvable.

O’Connor is joined by new recruits Kerry Washington, Glenn Close, Cailee Spaeny, Mila Kunis, Andrew Scott, Daryl McCormack and Jeremy Renner, thankfully not playing himself after his fictional hot sauce made for one of Glass Onion’s least amusing pop culture jokes.

What had spoiled the fun of the last one for me, and limited its rewatchability, was the feeling that Johnson had spent too much time reading the internet while he wrote it, buoyed by the positive reaction to the first film and overdosing on trending gimmickry, relying on humour designed to appeal to a terminally online audience (as a Covid film, that’s _somewhat_ forgivable). Strangely what seems to have fixed the third film is the very same practice but this time it feels like he has been focusing on the bad rather than good response to the second. Gone is the excess, the cameos, the smugness, everything that felt like a distraction and instead, all of that effort has been redirected to the basics of storytelling. Not that the plot here is anything close to basic, it’s as twisty and stuffed with second and third guessing as one would want but its charmingly convoluted nature feels as elegantly composed as it felt in the original, building to a finale that leaves us with a satisfied smile.

In Knives Out, Johnson’s online sensibility was also apparent but it was sparingly used in a smarter way to modernise an old-fashioned template. It’s used considerably more here but in ways that feel similarly thought through. Without clumsily making it the Knives Out film we need right now, Johnson jabs at the growing religious hypocrisy of the far right and how blind faith is warped to uphold figures too focused on the selfishness of power to do any real good. The obvious shadow of Trump looms over Brolin’s vile and destructive head of parish, whose double standards and hateful rhetoric do nothing to quell the unquestioning support of his followers. We have more than enough examples of blunt attacks on a beyond parody president mostly serving to make the left look self-satisfied and impotent and while to those with both ears open, Johnson’s prods are not hard to decipher, they are embedded in a way that also feels rooted in plot. This time, his knives are out toward bigots, charlatans, opportunists and YouTubers, targets that make it easy for us to cheer when he draws blood.

Craig is as mercifully re-energised as Johnson, after the risk of falling into parody in Glass Onion, the script finding new ways to add depth and discovery to the character and while not all of the new cast members have enough time to shine (Spaeny feels particularly shortchanged), there are no bum notes here with Close and Washington having the most fun aside from a standout O’Connor whose leading man status is now fully confirmed.

Set in upstate New York but filmed in the UK, there are parts of the film that often feel a little too set-based and artificial, not exactly cursed with the Netflix sheen but missing a certain old studio-level authenticity. It’s a minor complaint when the streamer is footing the bill for a series that’s really found its footing again, a wealth of fun to be had in ways that are constantly surprising, a franchise fully woken up.

# What to Know About the Murder and Suspects in _Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery_

Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

Before the premiere screening of _Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery_ at the Toronto International Film Festival, director Rian Johnson warned that it wasn't going to be exactly like the previous two installments of the franchise.

"We're going back to church," he said.

The new film from Johnson is a bit of a swerve from 2019's _Knives Out_ and 2022's _Glass Onion_. Whereas _Knives Out_ was cozy and _Glass Onion_ had a glamorous, eat-the-rich vacation sheen, _Wake Up Dead Man_ is a retreat into the gothic. It's still quite funny, but more malevolent in spirit with serious musings about the meaning of faith. It also lets Daniel Craig's beloved southern sleuth Benoit Blanc take a back seat. Here's what to expect from the film, which will get a theatrical release in November before hitting Netflix on Dec. 12.

## **What's the set up?**

_Wake Up Dead Man_ is centered around a Catholic parish in the fictional town of Chimney Rock in upstate New York called Our Lady of Perpetual Fortitude. That's where our narrator Father Jud Duplenticy (Josh O'Connor) is sent after he punches a deacon at his previous posting. Our Lady of Perpetual Fortitude is run by the virulent and mischievous Monsignor Jefferson Wicks (Josh Brolin). (In his first confession to Jud, Wicks talks about his constant masturbating.) Wicks inherited the church from his grandfather, who shamed Jefferson's mother calling her a "harlot whore." Father Jud and Monsignor Wicks immediately clash: Jud sees faith as redemptive, having turned to it after causing the death of a fellow boxer in his youth, while Wicks uses shame in his preaching. Wicks also has a loyal group of followers, who hang on his every word. And then, of course, Wicks turns up dead on Good Friday, causing Benoit Blanc to enter the scene.

## **Who are the suspects?**

Naturally, there is once again an all-star cast of potential killers. O'Connor's Jud and Brolin's dueling priests are in the mix, but there are also a host of Wicks devotees. Glenn Close is immediately creepy as Martha, who has been a servant of Perpetual Fortitude since she was a young girl and now wears all black and does the church's filing. She is adored by Samson, the loyal groundskeeper, played by Thomas Haden Church. Then there are Wicks' groupies. Jeremy Renner is Nat Sharp, a doctor whose wife left him, and in whom Wicks encouraged a burgeoning misogyny. Kerry Washington is Vera Draven, a lawyer whose father was close with Wicks. Her father also burdened her with looking after his illegitimate son Cy (Daryl McCormack), a wannabe GOP star who will spout any rhetoric to get ahead. Andrew Scott is hilarious as Lee Ross, a once beloved sci-fi writer who moved to this remote corner to get away from the "liberal hivemind." Finally, Cailee Spaeny plays a prodigious cellist wracked with chronic pain. She turns to Wick thinking he can grant her a miracle.

## **How does Benoit Blanc figure in?**

Blanc is called into town to solve the murder, but the film quickly becomes a two-hander between Craig and O'Connor. In fact, Blanc has a smaller part to play than he does in any of the previous installments. If anything, _Wake Up Dead Man_ is O'Connor's movie. Blanc largely stands on the sidelines as Father Jud drives the action. And it's his moral journey with which Johnson's script is preoccupied. He is a man who earnestly believes in his faith, yet has deeply recognizable struggles with anger and hatred. Whereas Wicks uses fear to manipulate, Jud recognizes how humans need belief as solace. Yes, Blanc helps solve the mystery, but the character you care about above all is Father Jud.

## **What are its influences?**

During his introduction, Johnson explained that _Wake Up Dead Man_ pays tribute to a hero of the mystery genre: Edgar Allan Poe. Later, in a post-screening Q&A, Johnson acknowledged his debt to the Father Brown mysteries by G. K. Chesterton. "I think it's a really great kind of peanut butter and chocolate fit, the notions of human grace and fallibility and all of those things in the murder mystery genre," he said. The movie itself also provides a syllabus of sorts. Blanc specifically acts out moments from John Dickson Carr's _The Hollow Man_ to illustrate the impossibility of the crime. That is on a parishioners' book club reading list that also includes a number of titles by Agatha Christie, a frequent touchstone for these films.

## **Why this swerve?**

_Wake Up Dead Man_ is a little less breezy than the other _Knives Out_ films, drawing its audience into genuine meditations on why humans choose to dedicate themselves to religion. At the Q&A, Johnson said that at the London premiere of _Glass Onion_ he and Craig started discussing how it would be fun to do something for their third collaboration "with this darker tone and something a little more grounded." It's an attempt to show the range of these films, though this is perhaps the last one for a while. Netflix bought only two sequels to _Knives Out_ in its 2021 $450 million deal. In July, Johnson told _Rolling Stone_ that he doesn't have an idea for a fourth in his head, but "I would keep doing them as long as I can."
