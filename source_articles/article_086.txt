Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India] September 8 (ANI): Dhanashree Verma's divorce from Indian cricketer, Yuzvendra Chahal, has been one of the most controversial topics of 2025.

Ever since the split, the social media influencer has faced harsh online trolling, with many calling her a "gold digger."

Now, Dhanashree, who is currently on Ashneer Grover's reality show 'Rise and Fall', opened up about her marriage and the criticism she faced. Speaking to fellow contestants, she said that respect was always important to her, even during tough times.

"When you are in marriage, then you are responsible ki dusre person ka bhi respect aapke haath mein hota hai. Chah kar main bhi disrespect kar sakti thi. You think I don't have things to say as a woman, but he was my husband. I respected even when I was married and I have to respect it now that I was married to him," she said.

Dhanashree and Yuzvendra Chahal tied the knot in December 2020 after meeting during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, their marriage ended earlier this year. The couple filed for divorce by mutual consent in February 2025 and were officially granted divorce in March.

During this period, trolling against Dhanashree grew intense. Things escalated when Chahal appeared at the final divorce hearing wearing a T-shirt that read, "Be Your Own Sugar Daddy."

In a new promo for Rise and Fall, Dhanashree was also seen addressing the "gold digger" tag with humour. In a promo for an upcoming episode, contestants were asked to choose between a gold bag worth ₹2 lakh and a silver bag worth ₹1 lakh. Paired with actor Arjun Bijlani, Dhanashree listened as he remarked, "Dekho mujhe diamond, silver thoda suit nahi karta. Mujhe gold suit karta hai (Look, diamonds and silver don't suit me. Gold suits me)."

Dhanashree then delivered a witty response with a reference to the trolling she has faced. She said, "Yeh line toh main bol nahi sakti. Agar maine yeh line bol di toh jo mujhe pyaar milne vala hoga vo bhi nahi milega (I cannot say this line. If I say this line, I won't even get the love that I am going to get)."

'Rise and Fall' is hosted by Ashneer Grover and features popular faces from the entertainment world including Arjun Bijlani, Kubbra Sait, Sangeeta Phogat, Anaya Bangar, Aarush Bhola, Akriti Negi, and Noorin Sha, Kiku Sharda, Dhanashree Verma, Aditya Narayan, Aahana Kumra, Bali, Nayandeep Rakshit, Arbaz Patel, and Pawan Singh.

Dhanashree Verma and Yuzvendra Chahal may have been divorced and have even moved on, but that never stops them from talking about their past. The choreographer-turned-actress has participated in Ashneer Grover’s reality show Rise and Fall. In the recent episode, she was heard talking about her ex-husband and revealed that she is not interested in love. She even touched on several topics, such as being disrespectful to the other person, etc.

We all know that after the divorce, Dhanashree Verma has been labeled a gold digger by fans. This happened after Yuzvendra Chahal wore the ‘be your own sugar daddy’ T-shirt. In fact, in an interview with Raj Shamani, he even revealed many issues in their marriage, which led to considerable discussion and criticism of the choreographer. Recently, in an episode of Rise and Fall, Verma spoke about taking responsibility for respecting the other person in a marriage.

“Sabke hath mein apni izzat hoti hai (Every person is responsible for their respect), and when you’re in a marriage, you’re responsible for the other person too, their respect also is your responsibility. I could have been disrespectful too, you think I don’t have things to say, as a woman? But he was my husband, I respected him even when I was married, and I have to respect the fact, I was married to him,” said Dhanashree. Further, the influencer revealed that she is not interested in love anymore. “I’m not cynical about love, maybe that’s a harsh word, but I’m not interested.”

Dhanashree Verma has been on the receiving end after the divorce. Talking about this, she said, “If you want to portray yourself in a good light, we would let our work speak; why put somebody else down to clean your image?”

Verma also stated that the amount of negative PR done about her is not going to help Chahal or anybody, and it’s simply a waste of time. She questioned, “And why do you need to clean the image, when no one is saying anything? That’s what denotes respect and maturity. You had a relationship at one point; how can you not respect it?”

Dhanashree concluded by saying, “When you know, no matter what I do, I am not going to be criticised, then you don’t have a fear. We live in a country that we know supports will be favoured to one particular side, still, if you want to discuss that, then it’s intentional, but it’s okay, please, everyone be happy.”
