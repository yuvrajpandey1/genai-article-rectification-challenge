# PM Modi to cast first vote in vice-presidential election

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will cast the first vote on Tuesday (September 9, 2025) in the vice-presidential polls, for which Union Ministers Kiren Rijiju and Ram Mohan Naidu, and Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde have been appointed election agents.

The post fell vacant on the first day of the monsoon session of Parliament, after Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned from the post on July 21 citing health reasons. The NDA has nominated Maharashtra Governor C.P. Radhakrishnan and the Opposition’s candidate is Justice (retired) B. Sudershan Reddy for the election.

Two days before the polls, the NDA and the Opposition had started preparations to train their MPs on the voting process. Mr. Modi, his Cabinet colleagues from the BJP and party MPs took part in a two-day workshop — “Sansad Karyashala” — starting on Sunday (September 7, 2025). The workshop also passed a resolution thanking Mr. Modi for the Goods and Services Tax reforms.

#### ‘Promote local goods’

At a meeting of NDA MPs on Monday (September 8, 2025), the Prime Minister laid out a plan of action to spread public awareness about the benefits of GST reforms. He suggested that the MPs organise trader conferences in their constituencies to inform the business community about the simplifications in the GST regime. They could also hold “Swadeshi Melas” during the coming Navaratri and Deepavali to promote domestically manufactured goods, which was essential for achieving self-reliance.

Mr. Modi said exhibitions should be held to support Indian products, local artisans, and micro/small industries in each parliamentary constituency. Calling the GST reforms revolutionary, he said it would benefit all sections of society and sectors.

He expressed hope that the new Vice President will uphold parliamentary traditions and ensure dignity and equal space for the Opposition.

Ramesh said the BJP’s numerical win amounted to a moral and political setback, asserting that the ideological battle continues undiminished.

After the Vice Presidential election results, Justice Sudershan Reddy extended his congratulations to winner CP Radhakrishnan. He emphasised that the broader purpose that united the Opposition during the polls remains "undiminished."
