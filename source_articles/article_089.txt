# Exclusive | Life Insurance Council, LIC to push roll back of retrospective GST changes, seek ITC relief

Published Date: Monday September 08, 2025

The Life Insurance Council and LIC are likely to write to the Ministry of Finance and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), seeking relief from recent Goods and Services Tax (GST) changes affecting the insurance sector, according to sources.  

The insurers’ first demand is that GST changes be made prospective, not retrospective. They want the industry to be allowed to claim input tax credit (ITC) on renewal premiums. ITC allows businesses to offset GST paid on inputs—such as reinsurance and commissions—against their tax liability, a benefit insurers say was already factored into policy pricing.  

Their second demand is to exempt commission expenses from GST. Currently, only reinsurance costs have been exempt from taxation. Reinsurance and commissions together account for nearly 90% of total expenses, and keeping commissions taxable creates an inverted duty structure—where tax on inputs exceeds tax on the final product—leading to unclaimed credits and higher costs for insurers.

Industry executives have said lower GST may not increase demand for insurance, as it is a “push product” and not driven solely by pricing. Analysts expect health insurers to face higher loss ratios, life insurers to see pressure on new business margins, and aggregators such as Policybazaar to be affected by lower commissions.

The Life Insurance Council is expected to meet the IRDAI chairman soon to seek his backing before approaching the government, the sources added.
