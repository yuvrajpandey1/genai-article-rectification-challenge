# Asia Cup 2025: Dubai International Cricket Stadium Pitch Report

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

During the Asia Cup 2025, the Dubai International Cricket Stadium will once again be the centre of big matches. Especially in night matches, the conditions here can change the course of the game. The pitch of this ground is generally considered balanced, where both batsmen and bowlers get a chance. But as the game progresses from evening to night, dew starts playing a big role and affects the result.

Fast bowlers often get help in the early overs. The new ball swings, and it is not easy for the batsmen to play shots. Scoring runs in the power play can be challenging. That is why teams prefer to be cautious to avoid losing early wickets.

Spinners are effective during day matches in the middle overs, as the pitch becomes a little slow. But the situation changes at night. The ball comes onto the bat faster under the light, making it easier for the batsmen to play strokes. Despite this, spinners may sometimes get some turn, but their effect is not as profound.

As the match progresses into the night, the effect of dew increases further. Bowlers, especially spinners, find it difficult to get hold of the ball. This affects the quality of bowling and benefits the batting team. This is why the team chasing the target is often in a strong position.

The statistics of recent T20 matches confirm this fact. The average first innings score in matches played in Dubai has been between 145 and 155 runs, but the statistics also show that the team that wins the toss and chooses to bowl often has success. In the 2025 ILT20, eight out of 11 matches were won by the team playing the second innings, which makes the effect of dew clear.

A similar trend may be seen in the Asia Cup 2025. Teams like Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan will probably prefer to chase the target after winning the toss. The batsmen will have to show patience in the initial overs and then take advantage of the situation. On the other hand, the fast bowlers will have to try to stop the runs in the death overs by using slow balls and cutters. Overall, the real winner of the game on a Dubai night will be the team that adapts its strategy by understanding the effect of dew and takes full advantage of the opportunity.
