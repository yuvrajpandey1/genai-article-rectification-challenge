# EOW summons Raj Kundra in ₹60 Cr cheating case

Published Date: Tuesday September 09, 2025

The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police have summoned businessman and actress Shilpa Shetty’s husband Raj Kundra in connection with the ₹60.48 crore cheating case which was registered against him on August 13. He will appear for the investigation next Monday (September 15).

“We had summoned Raj Kundra to join the probe on Wednesday, however, he sent a request through his representative that he will join on Monday,” said a senior EOW official. HT’s text messages to Kundra’s lawyer Prashant Patil remained unanswered.

Last week, the EOW issued Look-Out-Circulars (LOCs) against Shetty and Kundra, so that they remain in the city for the inquiry. The couple is known to travel abroad often.

The recent case of fraud being investigated by EOW stems from a complaint by Deepak Kothari, a 60-year-old Mumbai-based businessman and director of Lotus Capital Financial Services. Kothari alleged that between 2015 and 2023, Shetty and Kundra diverted funds he had provided, to expand their business, for personal purposes.

The FIR registered in Juhu police station on August 13, states that Kothari was introduced to Kundra through a common acquaintance. He was informed that the couple held nearly 88% shares in Best Deal TV, a home-shopping and online retail platform. Initially, Kundra sought a loan of ₹75 crore at 12% annual interest, but Kothari claimed he was later persuaded to treat the transaction as an investment to avoid taxation and promise of better returns.

Kothari said he transferred the entire money in tranches through 2015, but soon discovered that insolvency proceedings had been initiated against the company for allegedly cheating another investor. Shetty resigned as director in 2016. Despite repeated demands, Kothari alleged that Kundra delayed repayment, citing the Covid-19 pandemic.

The EOW, after a preliminary inquiry, found that the complainant’s funds had been misused. Shetty, Kundra, and an unidentified associate were booked under IPC sections 403 (dishonest misappropriation of property), 406 (criminal breach of trust), and 34 (common intention).

Police have also summoned the auditor who examined the firm’s books before liquidation proceedings were filed before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Investigators are tracing the money trail to determine how the funds were spent.

# Shilpa Shetty's Husband Raj Kundra Summoned By EOW In Alleged Rs 60 Crore Cheating Case

Mumbai Police’s EOW has summoned businessman Raj Kundra, husband of actress Shilpa Shetty, for questioning in an alleged Rs 60.48 crore cheating case registered against him on August 13.

According to officials, Kundra was initially asked to appear on Wednesday. However, through his representative, he requested more time and is now expected to join the investigation on Monday, September 15. A senior EOW officer confirmed the development, as reported by _Hindustan Times_.

Mumbai Police issued a Look-Out Circular (LOC) against Shilpa and her husband, Raj. The Economic Offences Wing (EOW), which is investigating the case, confirmed the move.

The complainant's lawyers, Dr. Yusuf Iqbal and Adv. Zain Shroff of YNA Legal, had earlier demanded that a lookout circular be issued in the case. In August, a case was filed against Shilpa Shetty, her husband Raj Kundra, and another person for allegedly cheating a businessman of over Rs 60 crore.

The complaint, filed by businessman Deepak Kothari, director of Lotus Capital Financial Services Ltd, claims the incidents took place between 2015 and 2023. Kothari alleged that the couple took the money under the pretext of expanding their business but used it for personal expenses instead.

According to Kothari, in 2015, Shetty and Kundra approached him through a mediator seeking a Rs 75 crore loan for their company, Best Deal TV Pvt Ltd, which promoted lifestyle products and ran an online shopping platform. The proposed interest rate was 12 per cent. Later, they reportedly asked him to provide the funds as an "investment" instead of a loan, assuring him of monthly returns and repayment of principal. Kothari claimed he transferred Rs 31.95 crore in April 2015 under a share subscription agreement, and another Rs 28.53 crore in September 2015 under a supplementary agreement.

The total amount was credited to Best Deal TV's bank accounts. Repeated attempts to recover the funds allegedly failed, and Kothari accused the couple of "dishonestly using" the money for personal benefit. Shilpa and Raj's lawyer Prashant Patil has denied the allegations and said they will present "our truth" before investigating agencies.
