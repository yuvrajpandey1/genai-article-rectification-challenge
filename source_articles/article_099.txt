South Africa’s Dewald Brevis on Tuesday became the most expensive player in SA20 history after he was signed by Pretoria Capitals for Rand 16.5 million, or Rs. 8.31 crore.

Brevis, previously with champion MI Cape Town, sparked a bidding war between Joburg Super Kings, Paarl Royals and MI Cape Town. However, the Capitals entered the race once his price zoomed past Rand 10 million before eventually placing the winning bid.

The 22-year-old was expected to be an attraction at the SA20 auction after he impressed as a replacement player with the Chennai Super Kings during the Indian Premier League 2025. Brevis replaced Gurjapneet Singh and was an instant hit with the side, scoring 225 runs in six innings at a strike rate of more than 180.

Last month, Brevis struck the second-fastest century (41 balls) by a Protea batter during a T20I against Australia. He also became the youngest South African to score a ton in the shortest format.

# Sourav Ganguly Hands Super Kings Major Dewald Brevis Blow, Capitals Secure Record Signing For 2026 Season

Sourav Ganguly handed the Super Kings a major blow over Dewald Brevis as the South African star earned big bucks ahead of the 2026 season. Brevis was signed by CSK as an injury replacement in IPL 2025 where DC decided against going for him post Harry Brook's pull-out.

While Chennai Super Kings (CSK) were able to sign Dewald Brevis in the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the 2025 campaign and secured his services for the long-term, but their sister franchise, Johannesburg Super Kings were not able to do the same in the South African T20 League (SA20), where Sourav Ganguly-coached Pretoria Capitals (PC), the sister franchise of Delhi Capitals (DC) made a record bid for him.

PC were the team with the highest purse coming in the auction and flexed their finances by signing Brevis for a record sum of R16.5 million (INR 8.31 Crores approx). The Super Kings fought hard to buy him and bid till the need but Ganguly's side prevailed.

Brevis' new SA20 salary is INR 6.1 crore higher than what CSK pay him in the IPL (Rs. 2.2 crore). Brevis played for MI Cape Town in the first three seasons of the league. However, the defending champions did not retain him despite him being a key player in their maiden title win, 291 runs in 10 innings at a strike-rate of 184.18.

Coming into the 2026 auction, Tristan Stubbs was the league's most expensive player after being signed for R9 million (Rs. 4.53 crores approx) by Sunrisers Eastern Cape. South African T20I skipper Aiden Markram became the first player to breach the R10 million mark as he was signed by Durban Super Giants (DSG) for R14 million (Rs. 7.05 crores approx). However, Brevis shattered that record minutes later and it is unlikely that someone will break it.

Seeing the Capitals franchise break the bank on Brevis only leads to more criticism over their actions in the IPL. After the ex-Mumbai Indians (MI) player went unsold in the IPL, it was DC that had a chance to get a free run at Brevis after Harry Brook pulled out of the 2025 season, a couple of weeks before the tournament started.

However, DC decided against buying anyone until the first week of May when they signed Afghanistan's Sediquallah Atal. CSK had a plethora of injuries and secured Brevis as a replacement for Gurjapneet Singh in mid-April.

Brevis made an instant impact at CSK with 225 runs in six matches at a strike-rate of 180.
