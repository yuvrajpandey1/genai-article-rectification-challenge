# Britney Spears’ friends, family worried as singer is living in messy mansion covered in dog poop

Is she living in a poison paradise?

Britney Spears’ friends are reportedly worried about the pop star as she is residing in a “messy mansion” that is covered in dog poop.

The “Toxic” singer is “having an episode right now, and we are going to see her battle through it the way she has for years,” an insider told the Daily Mail.

“Those close to her have seen this over and over again, and though it is monitored, they aren’t going to make any type of intervention,” the source added.

Another person from Spears’ family said they are “worried” about the Grammy winner, adding that she is “not doing well at all” and her friends and relatives are “terrified for her future.”

“Her house is a mess. She doesn’t clean up after the dogs, she doesn’t have someone there cleaning every day, and she just isn’t functioning like an adult would function,” they added.

Page Six has reached out to Spears’ rep for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Last month, the “Womanizer” singer, 43, sparked concern from fans after she posted a bizarre video of herself dancing in her cluttered estate in Thousand Oaks, Calif., with apparent dog poop on the floor.

Spears shared two clips of herself singing Rihanna’s 2006 hit “Unfaithful” and Prince’s “Kiss.”

In the posts, the “Crossroads” actress sang, danced and spoke in a British accent while wearing her “PJs,” which consisted of a polka-dot crop top, low-rise shorts and black knee-high boots.

Several items could be seen all over the floor in the background.

“Messing around with lighting and cleaning my house like no tomorrow 😳😳😳😂😂😂,” she captioned one of the posts.

Though Spears disabled the comments on her posts, fans took to X to express their concern about her behavior and the safety of her pets.

“God whats happened to poor Britney, is this the price of fame,” tweeted one person.

In November 2021, Spears famously broke free of her 13-year legal conservatorship.

She has since been posting more frequently on social media, including snaps of her being completely naked and some of her dancing with sharp knives.
